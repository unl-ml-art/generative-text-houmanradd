A few weeks ago, I was at a party where I got a chance to chat with some very interesting people. One was a man who is a great specialist in the various forms of psychic phenomena, and who is a great admirer of the great Russian Professor of Transcendental Psychology, Vladimir Soloviev. I asked him a few questions, and he became very excited and began to talk about his work. As I did not know much Russian, the transcript of his address is in Russian, and the meaning of his words is not very easy to understand:--

"The phrase 'perceptual science' is here employed in the technical sense of that seemingly curious word which I use for any branch of knowledge concerned with the understanding of the mind. Since we speak of the understanding of the mind, we must, of course, mean the apprehension of facts, and the understanding of them is the ultimate end of the knowledge of facts. The mind is made up of the information which it obtains from the senses, and the knowledge of facts is to it the means of acquiring these facts. It is, therefore, the ultimate end of the knowledge of facts. But how is it that the facts can be acquired at all, and not at any moment by some organ other than the intellect? This is the real difficulty of the psychological science. For when the facts are acquired, they are acquired by the intellect only: the latter, after the fashion of a machine, only gradually becomes the organ through which the knowledge of facts can be conveyed. This is, indeed, what is generally meant by the word 'brain.' But, on the other hand, the facts do not, in themselves, convey the knowledge. In the first place, they are facts only of the mind, but they do not convey all knowledge. The mind can know very little except what it has acquired from the senses, and these are all that the mind can know; and it is only later that it comes to convey all knowledge. This is what is meant by the term 'knowledge of facts' in the psychological science. Hence, if we wish to convey all knowledge, we must open the door to all knowledge, and this can only be done by the understanding of facts. You will, of course, be in a very good humour at hearing me use the phrase 'perceptual science' as an index to the word 'knowledge,' but I have not the heart for a joke. I am not anxious

preoccupied myself with
the subject, and came
into the study to see
Professor

Black.

"What brings you to this house, my
dear?" I asked, as I
seized the opportunity of looking from my
window.

"I have some business," he answered, "which calls
me here. You may come in, and I shall
talk with you."

I

seemed to understand at once what he meant; so I
seized the chance, and entered, and found him
in his study, with his arms folded, and his face
grave. He was speaking, as he always does when he
knows something, to himself; but with a trace of dignity
which I could not but be struck at. I was
entranced, and began to ask questions of great
interest; but he interrupted me, and said, as he turned to
me:--

"I must be quick in my work, and this is the time for my
inquiries. You will sit down, my dear; as I am not yet
ready to answer them, you will wait till I shall. You may
consult your friends for a moment, before you ask questions.
You are free to go at any moment. But I shall see that
everything is in order, and that you come at once."

As we sat talking, a knock came at the door, and I
saw Professor Black turn to his wife, and call out:--

"Come, Madam Mina!"

She came in, and saw him, and bowed, and said:

The No. 1 issue of the Sunday paper
is a diatribe against me by a woman who has been
deprived of her husband. I wish I could be of some use to her.
I can do nothing for her in a great way; that is the only reason
that I can give. I can only try to come as near as I can to
helping her as possible. She has grown sick of me and of the papers
that have been drawn up against me. She is going to have to deal
with me alone. I have to be careful to not upset her; she
is too sane to realise that I am mad, and I must not let her
judge me if I fail. I have had to confide in two dear friends
of hers who are not only of the same opinion as myself, but
have been with her in her old life, and they are telling her
things that she will not like. I am not sure if she will believe
them, for she is too sick to look for any proof. But she
will have to make up her mind for herself, and I am her only friend
in this dark period.

"The subject of the men who have been removed from us has
come up again, and it is here that we shall deal. The story
is told here. We have been informed that Mrs. Westenra is ill,
and that her husband, who is, in all probability, in the habit of
driving to her house whenever he hears the bells of Southend, has
been informed that she is dying. She has asked us to make it known
to the friends of the hospital that may be near, that if it be
necessary that any of them should be at any time injured, he
shall not hesitate to come; and that she is to be at her home on
the following Saturday, when she is to give an account of herself. We
request that you will kindly forward this to the husband as soon
as possible, and that you will also forward to Mrs. Westenra's friends
at the London Hospital, as well as to her husband

--Dr. Seward

The Quakers, the 'old' church in the West, are now, as ever, in the news.
It is a news which the press, and especially the English press,
are _always_ keen to report. It is a news which is just beginning to
come home to the great Quaker body in this country, and the press
are keen to get the story out. There are, of course, a few things which
must be kept in mind, and they are:

1. That the Quaker Church is long dead--that is, has lost all its
spiritual conviction; and that its members are inflexible and
self-sufficing in the things which they choose to do for their own
safety alone.

2. That it is a spiritual body, and not a material one; and that it
must be led by its spiritual leaders.

3. That the church is not a political body. If, in the present day,
the Quaker Church were a political body, it would be a very small one.
There would be only one or two hundred members, and they would
be either of one party or the other. There would be no national
party to lead them, but every movement to which they were attached would
be guided by their spiritual guidance. This is what the Quaker Church
is to-day, and it is the spiritual body which must lead it before the
time. It must be led by the wise men, by the learned, by the
spiritual men. These must be those who understand, and who are
inclined to do what is good for the body as well as the soul. This
is the church's destiny, for its earthly life is but a dream to it.
Our own day is only beginning to find out the meaning of this.
Indeed, to-day's children are only beginning to understand.

Our present age is a struggle for existence, and for the soul. It is
a struggle for existence for the whole of the body; and the soul may lose
its soul in its struggle. This is what is in store for the Quaker
Church. For

Papua New Guinea

The nearest big cities are Manukau and Port Moresby.


Manukau

The capital is in Eastern Cape, near the port of Mombasa.
The old capital was Thetford, which was burnt down in 1854, but
it was rebuilt twice, at a terrible cost to the population.
The present capital is called Petrograd, for the old capital of the
Russian Empire at the time of the Russian Revolution. I visited the
British Museum, and in the history books I found that in 1750, after the
Bolshevist revolution had been carried into effect, a proposal was made
that the towns and villages in Eastern Cape should be named after the
British. This was first brought to the notice of the British Government by
a letter from Lord Godalming, then Lord Godalming and Lord Godalming, to Lord
Quincey Morris, then Lord Morris, and then Lord Morris, and finally by
Mr. Morris. The result was evidently disastrous: for the towns and
villages named after the Exchequer were all destroyed, as was the
old capital. Now, after the ruin of the old capital, the
British Government propose to name the place after a person or persons
who are not British. This is the case with the capital of the
British Empire, Petrograd, in the Trans-Caspian region. The name is
previously used for a Russian general or soldier, but the Dictatorship
has made it so that Petrograd is to-day simply the capital of the
Czarina, who reigns in her own country. It is worth observing that
under the old system of government, the Russian troops who came into
exile in 1798 were entitled to the same rights as any other
British, and the latter could try to use them in their favour. The
Czarina, who is herself a Russian, is allowed to use the same privilege
with the troops who have come into Exeter.

The old Russian capital was at one time Thetford, as the Countess of
That City was called when he was a young man; but the name has since
been changed to Petrograd.

The capital of the Northern Territory is at present in the town
of Invercargill, on the

"You should be in a better place to talk about it," said Mr. Morris, "than you are."

"I am, sir!" I said, with a sort of sarcastic smile; "well, I shall be glad to tell you all about it in a minute.

"Let me tell you about this," he going over, "something which is very sad, and very
long, and very painful--a very sad and painful thing, for me; and which is
my duty to do,--I must make known to you, dear Madam Mina, what I have
learned from your late husband, who was the very man whom you called
my friend. I knew then that he was not who he claimed to be." I did not
like the way he spoke, and said:--

"You know what he was, sir? That was a very good man, quite reasonable
about all that can be reasonable, and very wise. He had a good
study, and he had a fine house, and he had all the comforts of a
noble man. He had a belt of gold in his purse, and he had some silver
in his pocket, and a ducat in his hand. And he was a very good man;
and you, my dear, were his wife. And then, my dear, there came a time
when you had lost all your children. You were alone. You were in grief.
And then a terrible thing came upon you. There came a time that you began
to think of your dead husband, and you began to pray. And there came a
time when you began to think of God, and you began to pray. And then
God appeared to you, and said to you: 'Look, here is my dear husband; I
give him to you, for you have lost all; I have given you all, and
all that there is.' You were afraid to die, but you said to yourself, 'I
am strong enough; I am of flesh and blood.' And so you took your life, and
went on living, and on life, and on life. And when you came to God, He
said to you: 'Look, here is my dear husband; I give him to you, for
you have all; I have given you all, and all that there is. Come

I just had the pleasure of interviewing Rufus Lord about the latest in his work.
This is the conclusion of his latest book,
The Transfiguration of Carsten:

"The Transfiguration was not, as I had expected, a simple
transfiguration, as was supposed. It involved a great deal of
tradition and much agonising, for when the great flame of God's loving
kindness had been kindled in my heart I could not help feeling that
there was some change which I might not like; and I turned to
myself and said: 'What change?' For a few seconds there seemed a
horrid silence. Then the Count said: 'Let us see.'

"I was so frightened that I hid in the room, and stood by the window.
He walked quickly along the floor of the hall, and at last entered the
room. I heard the Count call out: 'Let us go down into the hall,
and find some one to open the door.' I ran down the passage, and opened
the door. And then he said to me: 'Come, I want you now, and I want
you now fast. You shall be ready in a moment. Come now; you are far
away.' I came, and we went down into the hall. He closed the door, and
I saw his hand go down his armoury; and there he took a great
bow and a great crossbow, and a great many bolts, and set them on the
horseshoe. Then he took his great sceptre, and held it high, and said
to me: 'Fear not. Nay, but for your life I give it for you. It
shall not harm you; but you shall die in my hands, and die for my
good. But first, I need not hurt; for you are but vessel to me, and
you can neither harm nor harm you. There is much that is sacred in
it, and much that may be of use to man; but I need not harm, or
die, for you. I have already want, and must have it; and I think that I
am now but the beginning, and the end. This is the work which I have begun,
and which is to be completed; and I need not fear, that which I
shall not

The man was not a man of God. He was of the devil; and he had made an ass of himself.
The blood was on his hands, and he would not take it, though I had
stored in my vault a small quantity in a very well-marked box. I cried
out to him, and he turned and fled in terror. I must have sent for
some one to keep watch; but I know not where. He must have gone
away; for he threw himself on the grassy knoll between the house and
the church, and lay there, shuddering, as though crying out for help. I had
been prepared for this; for weeks I had been watching for such a
character, and I knew that the time was near when it would come. So
I hid the box, and went to the door, where I could get the key, and
started out.

When I got to the house I found that none of the servants was at work, and that
the man who had been at the window had gone away. I went down
the hall and found the man lying on the lawn between the house and
the church, and I threw myself on him and comforted him with my
ears and with my hands and with my face that I could. Then I took the
box, and hid it in a corner, where it is still, and in the night-time
go back and look for the body.

with myself. I am _praetor sancti_ and I have done all that can be done;
all that may be done. Dr. Van Helsing and I have been in constant
communication, and even to-day, when I went to bed, the subject of the
disappearance of the boy was broached.

I should have been distressed to lose my only student, but I do not
despise him. I do not wonder that he is so good-natured, for he is
quite the gentleman. He is a very good student, and I know him well;
we both went to the same school together

So, how do I get this over with?

I'm sitting here, feeling like a Russian peasant,
With my head in my hands, and my knees trembling under me,
And the fog of my own anxiety is lifting. Look here,
Arthur, I know you're right, but what do we do?

Arthur! look here, you're right! I'm nervous myself, and I'm
quite helpless! I can't help it! Look, I've got a bottle of
pearl-white brandy, and I've got a glass of brandy, and I've
got a glass of brandy, and I've got a glass of brandy, and I've
got a glass of brandy, and I've got a glass of brandy, and I've
got a glass of brandy, and I've got a fine old-fashioned glass
of brandy, and I've got a little glass of brandy, and I've got a
handful of brandy, and I've got a bunch of brandy and a handful of

what to say; I can't think a word, and I don't know if I can
bear to say a word. I'm so frightened, and I can't think. I
mustn't think of you. Oh, God, please, don't think; please, don't think
of me!"

And he went on in a whisper:--

you, my dear; I don't think of you at all! That is the death of me.
That is the death of me

from "The Journal of Henry George" by
Hans Holmwood Holmwood had once been a student of Aristotle at the
International University, but he is now a Professor of Geography in
the London School of Economics. He has lately been writing a
book of maps, and in it, with a view to the complete study of
the ancient world and of the languages spoken in it, are set down his
experiences in the various countries, and in the various languages
spoken there. He has read and written many books on geography,
the first of which is "The Geography of the Ancient and Middle
Ages," first published, he thinks, in 1769, in which are treated the whole
series of the American and British ills. The second, "The Geography of
the Roman and Oriental Empires," was published in the same year, and
arises, he thinks, from general ignorance of the subject. The third is
"The Geography of the Russian and Austrian Empires," and is
written in such a way as to prevent any generalizing from one country
to another. It is a useful work, very interesting, and has been
read and studied by many writers, not least Dr. Seward, who, in his "
Geography of the World," gives the English
 vernacular version, and gives a comparative table of facts. "The
landmass of the world," says he, "is not divided up into islands and
territories, but into man-made islands and natural ones. The man-made
islands are those of Europe, Asia Minor, and Africa; and the natural ones are
those of the North, South, East, and West." It is a useful
work, and the work of a great geographer, whose discoveries will be
of immense value to the world of the future.

Of the languages spoken in different countries there are, so far as
can be determined, two chief groups. In some of these countries the
speaking races are separated by very wide inland seas, and by
territories on the one hand, and islands on the other; so that the
territories, whilst they may have some national symbols, have no
common language. In these cases it is necessary, as we have seen, to
earn general knowledge of the peoples; we have found that the

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Two days after the criminal trial of the ex-Crescent City police chief began, a jury found him not guilty of all criminal charges.

The jury's decision was fast becoming the law of the land.

The court clerk's office here reported on Friday that the verdict was in, and that the verdict was a resounding "no" to the prosecution's theory that Vice-President Dan Quayle conspired with police to obstruct the investigation of the lead in the case of the missing girl, the Renfield.

The clerk's office reported: "The verdict of acquittal was made by the Court of Criminal Appeals just before closing of business for the evening."

The result of the trial of the former police chief, Arthur A. Lee, for obstruction of justice in connection with the case of the Renfield girl has been made public, and the result is a resounding "no." The trial court, in its verdict, simply said that the evidence had been sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the lead in the case of the missing girl had come from the office of the former police chief.

The conviction was brought by the city counsel, Arthur S. Hinkle, and was to be heard before the court of the present day, in the old City of Des Moines, the seat of public works, and in the chambers of the late latter, Arthur A. Lee. The occasion was the opening of the new hotel, the "Old City" hotel, which has been opened in its present form as a meeting place for different classes of people. The rooms are limited, and the only entry is by an open door. It was here that the learned and learned men and women, and the court officials, who had been waiting almost two hours in anticipation for the trial of the ex-police chief, were finally admitted.

There were not a few of the old friends and foes of the former police chief, as well as of the police officials, here. The chief's friends and foes were the two great newspapers, the "Blaze" and the "Crescent," as well as one or two of the local newspapers.

The men and women who were at the meeting of the "Blaze" and the "Crescent" were reported to have been very rejoiced at the result. A letter was handed to the effect that "the press is full of our happy news
====================
"I don't want to go back," she said, with a sort of pleading look in her eyes that made me want to throw myself on my knees before her and beg her to forgive me. I could not, however, do so, for I felt that she wanted to keep me here, and that if she let me go back to Miss Lucy, the affair might become the sort of scandal that might send me to her father and mother. I was so weak that I could only say that I did not want to go back, and hoped to see her when I came.

There was a long silence, and then she said:--

"I suppose it is because I am a woman, and because you are not a man, that I am so anxious about the matter. I can tell you that I am very sorry, for it is so terribly wrong, and I feel so selfish and unworthy. I am sorry that you have so dear a girl in your poor, poor dear heart, and that you should be so selfish in all you do. I am sorry that your poor, poor dear heart must have been so troubled, and that you must have been so at the thought of murdering her. I am sorry that you have been so loving, and that you have so cruel and so heartless a lover, and that you must have been so at the thought of torturing her. Oh, I am so sorry! but I must be strong, and I must be the strong one, and I must live with her, and I must hope that she will be one day free from this terrible burden, and I shall have to bear it alone, which is very, very awful. I have tried so hard; I have tried to be kind to her, and have tried to help her, and to help her so that she would not be sad or angry or hurt, and so I must suffer alone. But I can do nothing, and I am afraid!"

I did not know what to say, so she went on:--

"I am so sad, and I am so selfish! I love her so much, and I know that I have no right to do anything, and I know that if I did, she would go on torturing her for want of love, and I would be mad or cruel--either way! I have tried so hard; I have tried, on my own account, to save her life a hundred

A man, and to live as a man does.

Here's a great and wonderful specimen of the silly, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-indulgent American, as seen in my own life (p. 70).

That's a man!

So is this:

Good God! it is not me.

I am a man, and yet I am a mad, mad, mad man.

I am a mad, mad, mad man, and I will not stop.

I shall not stop till I have done everything;
the time is now, and I must go on.

       *       *       *       *       *

I have so found, and I have come to find out,
That for man to do good, is necessary to evil;

That the good only comes from the knowing; and that
in the knowing there must be a good-will; and that
the good-will only comes from the will to do.

I am in search of that self-knowledge which lies
in the heart, and which is in the knowledge that is,
which is the will to do. Ah, my friend, I find it! I find it
in my own nature; and I find it in all that we are.

I have come to find it among men. I have come to find it
in myself. I find it in the very nature of things.

I have found it in all the thousands of men and women
that have tried their brains and their wills and their
patients, and all the dead who have tried to do the will
of God, to find that which is right: to do good, and
to love well.

Good God! is that a bad idea, and a terrible one? Why,
yes, it is a terrible idea, and a terribly bad one.

But I shall be true to it. I shall be true to the will to
do good, and the will to do good, and the will to do the will.

I shall not stop till everything is done;

"And you'll have to, I suppose, arrange it, then?"

"I shall, I think. I could take it that way if I were you, for I can arrange things for you all day, and then you can go home when you please." He looked so thoughtful that I thought I could have given up the joke if I had to. And then I went out and asked the poor fellow to keep his word.

"You are a good fellow, Mr. Hawkins," he said, "and I wish you well."

I shall not refuse my dear good man any favour, for I feel sure that he would be happy to hear it of me.

I am so happy to-day, for I am going away for a month, and so I can take no more of this kind of nonsense.

_Later._--I have been punctual, and have had time to write. I have had a long and hard day, and have been so. I woke early, and went to the office early in the morning, for I had had a bad dream. However, I have written, by myself. I have also taken the phonograph and phonograph-record, and have put them all away. I suppose I should have told you all about my night's work, but I have a bad dream, and I do not wish to make a record of it. I shall try to write at lunch-time, or later, I suppose, when I shall be refreshed. I shall report to you all as we go on, so that you may have a record of what we have done.

I have got all the papers and the daily papers, and am writing this letter. Godalming is with me, and must have all the papers, as well as I can read. I am to be at Whitby by the afternoon, but I shall not be long. I shall in writing decide what to do, and shall let you know when
====================
"Oh, you frightened me, too!" said my old friend, beginning to raise his head. "And you are a good friend--I speak for myself--I hold you in my own esteem!"

"Friend? Is it not?"

"Ah, but I must be fair. I am a man of very few belongings; and I have no library with me. You have a great deal of it. I shall have more books to read in this week than I did in my whole life together."

"I shall!" I said.

"I shall!"

"And I shall."

"I shall!"

"And I will!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"We shall!"

"Yes, we shall!"

I can still remember the look of horror on our old friend's face as he realised my meaning, and then the light bloomed in his eyes again. He sat up straight, and his eyes glowed with a kindly light that seemed to melt away the gloom of death, and pointed to me:--

"Now, my friend, you have been a true friend, and have had much to say on every occasion. I know that you were afraid, and that your heart was breaking, and that you trembled with remorse. But I know now that you are not alone; that there are others like you who have suffered the same fate. I have been looking for you, and you are to be found. You have been found. You have been found."

He took my arm and led me into a large, dark, windowless room. It was dark, and even here the moonlight streamed in through the window. There was a big chest on the floor, and on it were many books, all of varied vernacular, all of the most interesting kinds. There was also a big, solid oak box, the top of which was open, and covered over with many thick papers, all in the most interesting tongues: English, French, Russian, and so on.

The room was very dark, and though we had the light of the stars, all we could see was a mass of papers and books, piled in a circle in a heavy heap on the

Maggie

It all came together when a nurse
took a gold watch and a gilt emerald from her box,
and said, "These things are very precious; let me have them."

I was afraid, for I had not been to see the Count, but had
gone with the rest to the Count's house to see Miss Lucy's
room. The door was shut, and when I opened it, they were all
crying. The others were all crying more, and the Count was
trying to comfort them. When he saw me, he said, with a great
laugh, as I stood looking at him, "You are a fool, for I have
nothing to grieve you with."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"I am here to give you the emeralds, and you to take them."

"What do you mean?" I said.

"I am here to give you a gold watch, and that of a gentleman,
of a very noble blood, both of whom are dead. These are all
in your box. You can have them as you please; take them or I will
destroy your house."

"How can I take them?" I asked.

"Because they are of considerable value to you, my friend. Take
them or I will destroy your house; if you do not take them or I
destroy you, I will." He took the gold watch, and with a smile
and with a farewell said solemnly, "I will not lose one of them any
more." Then he took the emeralds. I saw that he was not content
to take the others, so I said to him:--

"I do not wish to lose my house; what do you want from me?"

"That you will not lose any more of them." He answered with a
gentle smile, and then added, as he held the emeralds out to me:--

"Then I shall not lose them; then you shall not lose them."

"But--but!" I said. "If you will not let me take them, I
shall take some other; then we shall be able to work out a fair
fair trade. And if you do not let me take more, I shall take
some other; then you shall

I am proud to announce that I am going to France to see my beloved and once-feared,
Arthur Conan Doyle.

My friends, I am so glad you are with me, for we shall go through many
terrible sorrows together. I am sure you will all be glad to know that
I am not a lunatic or a madman, and that I am not in any way anxious about
my dear Madam Mina. I am only heartbroken, and I feel that all my thoughts
are with her. If anything do happen to her, I shall be sure to tell you.

Oh, and I must tell you all about Arthur. I have so much to tell you that it
will seem very strange if I write all over again. You know that I
wrote all over again when I wrote all over Arthur. I hope, too, that
this time you will forgive me. I have only just begun. I fear I shall have
to write this in the evening, for I must go to bed. I shall try to tell you
as soon as I can, and then you shall know all.


_Arthur's Journal_

_1 September._--I got up early. I must go to bed early, for I must tell
you all about Arthur. I must go to bed the better to-night, for I fear
to have told you all. It is so strange to me that I should have been
so anxious to-night. It seems that to-day I was as angry as ever with
myself, and as though I should have left my dear Madam Mina in a foul
grave, and as though I should have done it without a moment's thought.
It is no wonder, then, that I am angry with myself. Well,
once more I must go to bed early, for I must not let my anger blind
my mind; and so I must just as soon be angry as I can be.

I must go to bed early, for I must not let sleep in, and I must not
sleep till all is well again. I must go to bed early, for I must not
sleep a wink, and I must not sleep till all is all right.

I must go to sleep early to-night. I must have sleep, and not a word,
not a sound
====================
My last post was a bit of a disappointment, as I didn't get around to writing it for a month at most. I promise I'll try to get in the habit of posting more often. I've been trying to put the pieces of my life back together.

I'm at work again. It does help to get out of bed and taking the stairs, and to do something organised. I'm going to write now about some of the more interesting things that have happened to me in the last few weeks, and about the little rift between my father and me. I am not quite sure why it is that, since the last post I have not written a word. I suppose it is something about me not being able to write. I suppose I am getting used to it. I suppose I am beginning to fear that I shall not be able to write at all. I shall have to go on so doing what I can do alone. Of course, I shall try to write in case I can.

I am getting tired of writing about the things that have happened. I don't think there is any point in doing them all, and so I shall stop. There is something solemn about the whole thing, and I don't think it is worth the trouble to write about it. I am afraid that it is not worth the trouble to write about anything. I think I may as well go on writing about myself, for I have done it all, and there is nothing to see or think about.

There are other things that have happened. To-day came the report of the messenger. His report was that he had seen; and if I may so read from his report, it was this: "I saw two men, one white, one black, pass along the dark passage, with their arms folded, which was round the tomb. The one who was white held up his hands in triumph. I distinctly remember the colour of his face; it was that of a triumphant and cheerful disposition."

       *       *       *       *       *       *       *

_1 August._--I have been writing, and have just finished a few pages of a paper I have been writing on the subject of this report. I shall now look at it.


====================
If you're a regular reader of this blog, you know that I have a love affair with cats. I have seemingly fallen in love with the poor little useless thing, and have been so jealous of his dear Mina that I have kept a box of her clothes in the corner of my room. I do not know how I managed to get hold of her clothes, for I was still so excited over her that I did not notice. I suppose it is an instinctive, if not a conscious, instinct, to keep a cat's clothes around, for surely there is something in its sight which makes it excited.

But now I find out that there is something in Mina's clothes which makes me more than aroused; it is that she is a cat, and that she has had a cat's head. I am determined to have this transformed into a crime. I have got my sergeant, Mr. Morris, to drive her to the house of the person who gives her the head and hands it on, and I shall have it tried by a man, who is an excellent specialist in such things, on the spot where the head is found. It is time that the criminal punished the criminal. I shall keep a special watch, and shall make sure that no one else may see her naked. I shall take her to the station, and will close the case if it be yet open; I know the man who found her head, and I shall have it tried in his office. This is the preliminary. If it be a murder, then I shall prove it, and then the body of the poor girl may be cut up and thrown in the river. I shall have it tried by a criminal and then, if found guilty, I shall get a new trial for the other woman who has had her head cut off. So, to-night, criminals, you must be prepared to take your chances; there is no such thing as absolute innocence, but there is always the chance. I shall be watching you, and I shall not be waiting here.

"I shall send for Lucy to-morrow morning. I shall not have dinner with her, but, after dinner, we shall go for a walk; I shall tell her all that has happened, and we shall discuss the case together. I shall follow you if you go by the A24, for I know where you are going. I shall send you a letter, too, so that you may return
====================
We had a long discussion about the "Mixed Coopers." They are not just similar in their form and number, but their nature.

I am afraid, Miss Mina, that when you have seen the breed, you will not
accept my explanation. You will believe that the "Red Coopers," as they
are called in my neighbourhood, are of the same breed as the "White Coopers."
They are both very strong and very cunning; but their cunning is of a
distinctly different kind from that of the "White Coopers." I shall explain
that later.

"We," we went away to dinner with our companions, and at table, and I
found that Lucy had not eaten her supper. She said she would not, but I
asked her why. She said simply: "I don't like the smell."

"Oh, I see," I said; "why not?" She answered:--

"Because it makes me sick."

"You are not sick, Lucy," said Van Helsing coldly, "but you must be
sick. You must be without appetite."

"I don't want no appetite," she said, "but I am sick." She went on:--

"I don't want no food, but I am sick. I don't want no food, but I
want some comfort; some peace and quiet in my life--I don't know
why I should ask it, but I want it; I want peace; and I want
that peace when I am dead. I don't know why I should want it, but
it must be. I don't know why I should want it, but I do. I don't
know why I should want it, but I do. I don't know why I should want
it, but I do. I don't know why I should want it, but I do; I
do; I don't know why I should want it, but I do; I don't know
why I should want it, but I do; I don't know why I should want it;
but I do; I don't know why I should want it; but I do; I don't know
why I should want it, but I do! And I do! Believe me, my dear,
I know why I should want it
====================
Then he went on:--

"But what about the patient? He is so young, and so healthy, and so strong. There is no cause for despair; he is, I trust, in a like condition as we were."

"Then I have got him," said Dr. Seward, as we were alone. "And, my good friend, what do I have?"

"A certificate of successful operation."

"A certificate of successful operation?"

"Yes, of course. I have done this operation, and there is no cause for despair."

"Aye, but what will be of use to you, friend John, is this; the patient is a young man; his condition will not improve for some time. But, my good friend, I have seen him play, and he is a very good-looking fellow. You will not much want a young woman to marry him, or a young boy to play with him? Is that so? Well, you will have that. Forgive me, friend John, if I am harsh. It will be, I know not what, for a long time. No, it is not so, for that will be a time when fortune will favour you. Oh, but it will be a long time, and you will have had many a day to think of him, and to write letters and call at his house. But, my good friend, he will come back, and you can trust me, and he will go away rejoicing that you have been faithful to him. But when that time comes, there must be sorrow and anguish, and you will not be of sound mind. You will not be of sound mind; and then you will not be able to act. It is hard to know when to trust and when to distrust. I am here to help you in the dark. You will not trust me till you have seen the patient, for I will be your friend; and if I have any doubt, it will be for a moment. You will not trust me till I tell you the good news."

I was not at all surprised at this proposal, for in a way my own anxiety was at stake, since I was at present only able to hear what he said.

It came at last as a sort of warning message to me. I answered him with silence:--

"Teacher, you will not be long
====================
"To hell with it, I left it for your good. You must have felt that burn, for I know the way. You must have felt what you must have felt; you must have felt the fear that we were coming to an end. I know. You must have seen the face of the woman who had loved you, and who, though she was dead, is still living, and whom you loved so, and whom I love much. I know. You must have seen the scar, and the agony, and the physical pain, and the mental pain. I know. You must have known she was mine, and that I was coming for her, and that we must destroy each other which we are. I know. You must have seen the shock, and the pain, and the shock and the pain, and have come to an understanding that we must destroy each other; that we will destroy him that we can, and that we will destroy him that we cannot; that we must destroy him in the body that we are in, that we may destroy him in the body that we shall be in, that we may destroy him in the mind that we shall be in, and that we may destroy him in the heart that we shall be in, and that we shall be in all that we do; that we shall be for ourselves, and others, and for ever. I know. You must have known, and felt and known, and dared and dared and dared and dared, and came and came and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came, and came
====================
"We shall see," said he, "and then we shall see. When the battle is won, when the moment has come, then shall we seem to have won." Then he went away, and I could not but think: "Doctor, this is going to be the happiest day of my life, and it is sure that I shall be proud to be a part of it."

The life of an American doctor is full of happy dreams, and it is a wonderful thing to think of in the morning. God bless the brave men and women who go by the name of "dear" to these men and women who are doing all they can to save the lives of so many brave men and women! The hope they have for their fellow-citizens will never die!

Before I go to sleep I shall ask one more question. You tell me that you have visited all the States.


_Letter, Mina Harker to Madam Mina, Mina Harker's Journal._

"_25 October._

"My dearest Madam Mina,--

"I must have the report before I leave. It was a very interesting day, and I must say that I am glad that you were not with me. You will be with me in making a report from Miss Lucy. We are to meet at Dover, and we are to leave at nine o'clock, for I have a very important visit with you to make. It is a sad day that you and I should leave this place, and it seems to me that time would do much for us. We shall meet again, and I shall leave you with this message; if any of you who are free shall have the pleasure of seeing Lucy again, I shall write to you, and shall be glad you did. If it does not please you to hear it, or if it does, I shall not trouble you about it. I shall keep you updated all the time. I have written to Miss Lucy, and shall keep her informed of my plans till we meet. If you please, I shall forward this to all the others who may be with us.

"Yours ever,

"Mina Harker.

"_25 October._

"John,

"I have not written a word to you for some days. I have been almost in a daze, and have been troubled all the
====================
between the two of us

and I can tell you, no matter how much I may

what our friendship may have been, that we have been

lovely friends till now. Do you think there is anything
in all this strange mix? Do you not see that there is
more in it than you think? Do you not see that we have been
friends from the first, and that we are friends for life?

Are not these things very strange to you?

"Friend John, I have been thinking of you. Do you not remember
when we first met, and then only in the car, and then
in the chapel, and then at the hotel, and then in the
hotel room, and then at the steam-room, and then in the
tunnel, and then in our room in the Count's house, and then
in the castle, and then at the opera, and then in the
night-room, and then at the opera-house, and then in the
main hall, and then outside the castle, and again when we
were gone, at the carriage-station, and then outside
the castle, with the carriage still coming. Do you not
remember?"

"Yes," said Van Helsing. "I did."

"And what did you think of it?"

"Oh, I thought it was wonderful. I was very glad that there
was such a thing as friendship between us."

"And what did you think of it when we had finished our
excommunication?"

"Oh, I was glad too. I was glad that the end of the world
had come. Thank God, it was only a very short time. Thank God
too, I was not dead, for it would have been a real bitter
end to me to be so, if I had lived to-day, and had died at
the end of the world, as I must surely be." He looked
intoxidated, and I could see that we were in for a shock, for he
turned and said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, you should know that it is only when we are
on the point of death, or when we are in danger of it, that we
talk of death. It is only when we are talking of it that we
can think of death. That

His smile is sweet.

I can't help it. There's something
in the way he looks at me that makes me like a
good friend. I hope he likes me for it.

Keats. I thought that might interest him.

He told me that he had read all the Lord Godalming's
book of Shakespeare, except the last one, which he had not
tried. He said that it seemed to him as though it were the
selection of the men and the women of a play, whilst the
truth of it lay in the couplet which came after. He added that he
did not know how to read, but was so good that he would do it for
my sake:--

"You will see, my good fellow, that a good man can be something
much more than he is. You will see that a good man is not so good
by his faults, but by his virtues. That is one of the
common things in life. I have seen men who were so good as to deal
with their fellow creatures as though they were dogs. I have seen
men, if I may use a technical word, who were sheep by nature.
But, my dear fellow, I have seen men who were buffaloes, and who
had the face of men by nature, and the licks of the beast by
nature. I have seen men who were swans by nature, who changed into
water-fowl by the baptism of fire, and who had the grace of God
by nature and by the good-will of man by the works of righteousness.
I have seen men by nature, who were tigers by nature, and who
had the blood of lions by nature and by the blood of lambs by
nature. I have seen men by nature, who were wolves by nature, and
who possessed the wisdom of baboons by nature and by the knowledge
of men by the hardihood of reason. I have seen men by nature, and
who were saints by nature and by the gifts of the Holy Ghost.
I have seen men by nature, who were angels by nature and

The best thing about the first day of these operations is that we have a big staff of men. They are not all under arms, but they have knives, and some of them, I think, are box cutters. Every man is armed with a pistol, and there is a big revolver beside him. We are not in the habit of recruiting our men in this way, but they are all equipped for the job. The men are very well fed, and I do not, I dare say, see any want of provisions. I do not know how we are going to get away. My men have been ordered to get out of here as soon as possible, and we shall see what we can of that.


_Letter, Lord Godalming to Bligh, Mina Murray, Lucy Westenra, and Seward, from Lord Godalming to Mr. and Mrs. Seward._

"_24 September._

"My dear friends and sisters:--

"1. We must now go through something of a dilemma; for, as we have been in earnest, we can hardly be so ready as before. We have done our best, and we must do even more; but we must not shrink from anything. It is a terrible thing for a man to look at a woman, who does not give him the same thrill as the other women--the women who draw him closer, or who kiss him, or who have the same feelings as he does,--and who is not controlled by some instinct which he has that leads to passion. He must not lose sight of this, for anything that may lead him to passion, may lead to it. The instinct that makes a woman submit to his will is that which makes a man happy and contented. It is this, that she is of his kind--that is to say, of his blood. He must not shrink from this, for he must never feel himself more than he ought to feel. He must not shrink from it, for he may be able to prove his manhood in the eyes of the women who love him.

"2. It is a terrible thing to contemplate, and it is a terrible thing to believe. I do not quite believe it myself, but it seems to me as though nature, in making such a fair and lovely creature as he to be an enemy to man, and to be so strong that he can defy her, has made
====================
I was sitting on the porch, looking out on the mountains and the orchard, when I heard a low, soft, softly spoken voice.

"How dost thou sleep?"

The poor fellow was breathing hard.

"I don't know," I said. "I was just looking out of the window, and then the window was thrown open and the moonlight came in;
and then I was lying on the porch, and I heard some one coming and going. I knew it
wasn't lying outside, for I heard the heavy steps of three men going up the steep
path over the orchard."

"When did you hear it?"

"Just now, when I heard it."

"Did you look out?"

"Yes, I did, but it was so dark, and the moonlight so dim, that I couldn't see
well enough to notice. But when I came back to the house, I had the impression that
there was a woman sleeping, and that she was breathing very softly. I ran up to
her, and I could hear her breathing softly, and I ran back to the window, and there
was a hand on my throat, and she was holding on to me. I tried to push her
away, but she fell back, and I heard her breathing softly again, and I moved
back to the window and saw that the moonlight was too dim to see. I ran back
to the door to the house, and tried the shutter, but there was no moonlight.
I ran back to the porch, and tried the window, but the moonlight was too
dim to see. I went back to the window and opened the door, and there she
was. I bent over to kiss her, and she was sleeping. I couldn't wake her
from it; so I tried to wake her mouth, and she was asleep already."

"How long have I been here?" I asked, and he answered in a rage:--

"Four long hours."

"Four hours since!" I said. "I am going to bed."

I could not have asked for a better man. He was cheerful, patient, and
intrepid. He said, without a whit of irony or irony of any kind, that he
could not believe that the poor fellow could have been in the habit
====================
the things you have seen.

I have seen

the whole earth

all night long

and

without sleep

I shall tell you

all that there

is to know

all that there is to know.

And so I tell you,

and you too, my friend,

all that there is to know

all that there is to know.

But do not despair!

I have seen

the whole of the universe

and it is not over all;

and as the stars are

but light for me in the dark,

so you, my friend, are but

light for me here in the light.

_Later._--We were all very tired. I was sleepy already. It was now early in the morning and, being in bed, I could not move. I was, however, not sleepy, for Van Helsing came to bed with a big glass of brandy, and set me down on the sofa. I was not sleepy at all, and so kept talking. He was a very serious-looking fellow, with the heavy brow and the thin nose of a professor. He was a good deal of fun to talk to, and he did not seem to mind my being sleepy. He was very earnest and earnest-looking; he had the air of a paladin, or a martyr. He gave me a big old crucifix, saying that it was his, and that it was a solemn and sacred thing, and that he would not take it from me unless I would promise not to take it from any other, for I had sworn an oath not to take it from him before. He showed me his papers, which were in a little table in the corner; he opened them and showed me the past papers, and then showed me the sacred book and said in a grave and solemn tone:--

"And now, friend John, tell me of your coming to Amsterdam. I have read all you have written, and I know all about you; but I have never heard of you. Tell me, friend John, why you should come."

"I have always been a stranger here;
====================
May I make a special request for both you, my dear?

Did you ever read "The Last of the Mohicans"?

No, I did not. Is it not so?

It is. It is also the story of my English and of
my poor, poor friend John. I read it over a glass of brandy
and red wine with a good steak and roast chicken. I think I
started to drink it too much, for then I had to ask myself,
"What does it mean to be a good man?" Is it that I am
good, or am I good only because I have to be good? I wish I
could ask you to write history, to tell the good and the
bad, the good and the bad, the good and the bad. I am getting
very keen. Good-bye.


_Mina Murray's Journal._

_5 May._--I want to pay special regard to you both, and to
all the friends I have, and to all those I might please. You
must have been most anxious about me, Mina. You know how much I
love you, and yet I fear that till the end of my days, I shall
never know your love for me. I must not let you, or any one else for
that matter, know of my despair. You must be brave, and you must
be brave now. You must go to my house and see for yourself,
without the slightest shadow of doubt, that I have loved you and
that we are destined to be together. If you don't go, then
I shall tell all to my dear Lucy and all of the world that we
are together. I shall not tell it to any one else. Come. I
am going to the opera.

_Later._--I want to tell you now that I have told it all. I went
to the opera; you went to the hotel, and then I came home. It
was a terrible experience, for when I got home I found that your
love was so great that I could not stop loving you. There was a
spark in my heart that made me promise you my word that if
====================
Whether it's a shoplifting suspect who shows up at court wearing only his underwear, or a man who asks to be released on bail after he's been caught with two boxes of cigars, police are doing what they can to ease the anxiety of the public.

In what some are calling a "new normal," all of the nearly 30,000 criminal court cases in the country are being recorded. Each day, more and more people are entering the system, who may later be considered in court.

"It's a great help," said the Superintendent of Criminal Justice Services, H. Morris Harker Jr. "The more cases, the more information we can get in, and the better chance we have to work out how to do our jobs better. It's a wonderful thing."

The figures for the past week are not yet available, but the figures for the whole of last year, when the latest data are available, show that there were only about 500,000 criminal court cases reported to the police in the United States last year. There were, however, over four million criminal court cases filed with the court in each of the previous three years, and there are now more than five million criminal court cases on record in the country.

"This is like an elephant that's been driven mad," said Mr. Harker.

"It's a frightful thing," added the Superintendent. "We have to keep up a good deal of the pace. It's a way of life in this day and age. There are a whole lot of people who are so anxious about their personal safety that they are willing to accept anything. It's a much-needed measure of national sanity. This is one of the few times when the police have been able to do anything to help."

The figures for all other years since the experience of the last, when the number of criminal cases was at its highest, are given in the table.

The figures for the first five months of the following year are as follows:

"I will tell you the name of the man who is the cause of all this.
He is a man from far off, who we have seen, and who we know, go to
this place. He is a man of extremely light eyes and a strong
vigor, and we have seen him in the village where I live. He is a
good man, so we have had many good calls on him. The man himself, I
am afraid, is not so good as I had expected to meet, and I fear I
may have come too far in my search. My friend on the other hand, is
very much the man of the world. He is a very good-looking man, with
a very good face, and a very fair nose. He is well-dressed, and his
own clothes are very nice, for he is a man of the world. He has a
very strong will power, and I believe he has a very strong mind, for he
seems to have a sort of free will, and he has made up his mind that all
that is is good and holy, and he will not listen to any argument, even if
it be of the devil, and that all is good. He has made up as a rule that
the only thing that can be evil is good, and that all must be so, and that
nobody can do anything bad. He is very simple-minded, and I think that
is one of the causes of the trouble. He has got a very wonderful mind
and a very wonderful power, for he can change his mind for twenty-four
hours, and then he is like a child again, and he goes and does what he
wants, and so there is no one to interfere. At first I thought that
he was using this power to destroy me, but I found out that he does
it all for my own good. He is a very good-looking man, with a very
beautiful nose, and a very fair one, and he has a great good-humoured
face. We have had many good calls on him, and I have seen him come and
go from this place, and has been very hospitable to me and to all the
people we have met. He has a sort of golden-haired face, and he is
very good-looking. He has a very strong
====================
When I had come to my own room, I went, as before, to the window, and peeped out, so that I might not have to close my eyes for fear of the rain. There was a pretty moonlight coming in through the puddle, and the moonlight seemed to make a bed of fog on the water; it was the same sort of strange effect which I had before seen in my own room. The wall of the room was covered with a sort of white sheet, and I crept on deck into the darkness, where I found the ship still moored, the sails in good order, and the sails lashed by men who looked as though they had been working for some time, for the masts were all in good order. The wind was easterly, and there was a gale blowing, which blew back the fog, and made the place look all white and grey. I got my box-lady out, and having made her sit in the seat she had made, and having placed the box on her, removed the lid, and looking in, found that the box was empty.

Having examined the box, I went down to the stern to where the hatchways lead to the lifeboats, and found that there was a distinct difference in condition from when I had seen her. On one side of the ship, sitting on the stern, lay the captain's chair; on the other, lying on the deck, lay the chair where it had rested on the deck before the storm. The door to the chair was broken, and I found that the seat was empty, but that the chair the captain had sat in was loose, and a foot or two behind the seat. I took the chair, which was of old sail-cloth, and laid it over the seat, which gave me a good view of the whole ship. I had a good look at the hatchways, for they were all full, and I had a good view of the deck.

There was much to be desired, for the wind was now gusting from the north-west, and was blowing very, very hard. I had a good look round the ship, for she was very busy with the works, and I was sure that in a few days the wind would blow her all away. The weathermen are quite right, for now and then a storm will occur which will send the ship over the water.

I am afraid that

SALT LAKE CITY — A former student at the University of Utah who is suing the school, claiming he was denied a women's shelter, has filed a complaint with the state's child welfare agency, which regulates where children can go for shelter.

Butte County Judge Jonathan L. Wigmore, who decided the case on Friday, said he would not be ordering any action against the school.

"I don't see any alternative to being very, very careful about what I say," the judge said.

Dr. John M. Sorenson, a professor of anatomy and of experimental zoology at the university and the lead lawyer in the case, said that the facts of the case held out to him as such:

That young women who have been mistreated by their husbands are more likely to take to a man who is not good husband or father than they are to take to a man who is good husband or father. That a man who comes from a "bad" home, but who has devoted himself to the good, becomes a good husband or father is a fact. That there is a stronger, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring, more enduring,

The problems of men have always been linked with the development of their powers; and it is only in a new system of life and of thought and of action that the problem of the limitations of man can be solved.

The first problem to be solved is this: What is the purpose of the powers of man?

The first and best answer is that man is a spiritual being. This is the great reason, if there be any reason, for the study of the soul; and it is this alone which can answer the first problem.

But, alas! there is one more, which is but little understood, and which may have a much-needed, if undeveloped, influence in the solution of the rest.

To answer it we must go back to the beginning; to the time when the soul and the body were in a state of rudimentary unity, and when the psychic life of man was in an almost absolute condition; when matter was the only true medium of the soul, and when the soul was, in a word, at the beginning of her development.

This is, I think, the true beginning of the study of man.

We may begin with the origin of the soul.

The first idea which man has that matter can have is that matter can be the medium of his soul.

This is, I think, the first step to the deeper and more beautiful and true unity of the soul and the body.

We may go further back.

The soul was, in an old way of thinking, simply the body or, more properly, the soul was the body.

When men first started from matter, and began to think of life on a material plane, this was their idea.

But as men have come to think of life on a spiritual plane, they find that matter can have no other medium of the soul than matter.

When men started from matter, and began to think of death, they found that death can have no other medium of the soul than matter.

When they started from matter, and began to think of the unity of the soul and body, they found that matter can have no other medium of the soul than matter.

If we go back further than this, and we look at the first ideas of man, we find that the soul was originally the body, and the body was originally the soul.

There is a new way of living. The way of the specialist, of the specialist who can do his job with the little time he has left. To-day the specialist is free.

He who can do his job in a minute, and who has the means, the nerve, the endurance, the spirit, will do it.

When he writes his report to the head of the work, and says that, in twenty-four hours' time, he will be coming out again, and will, I trust, tell you all about it, you will feel that you are not alone, that there are others who can tell you the same thing.

They began to pray together.

"For God's sake, Joseph! Why do you insist on
trying this new trick?"

"Because I want to find out what exactly this new trick is
and what it means!"

"But you don't mean to hypnotise us. We, too, are hypnotised."

"Oh no, no! I have, and the results are wonderful! I have
just hypnotised my patient, and now he is full of fresh hope.
And he is quite right in his hope, for I have hypnotised him before
all that is new to him. He said to himself: 'I know now what is best
for me.' He is a brave man, and he saw the coming of his doom,
and he knew what was best for him. Now he sees that his doom is
but a little way off, and that, if he work hard, he can possibly
reach it. Now he asks himself why he has to do what he does,
and why he should not do what he thinks is right. He has got to
do what he knows is right; and he knows that, if he can just do
it all over again, the end shall not be far off. So he gets as
far as he can, and then he turns away and hopes that the end may
come soon enough. And then he may even try to achieve it, and then
he shall have achieved what he set himself. I am hypnotist and he
discoverist! I have hypnotised him, and now I must do it all over again.
That is the end of the world; the end is nigh."

The Professor was silent for a minute or two, and then he said:
"Well, madam, I have not seen you so cheerful or so cheerful-looking
in a very long time. But I suppose that is because you are so sleepy.
The truth is that we have been buzzing about the subject all the
morning and all the afternoon. I have had the advantage of speaking to
many different hypnotists all day, and I have come to the conclusion that
there is no one who has not been hypnotised. Oh, but there are
some who know, and some who do not know; and there are the learned
and the unlearned. If we only knew how to use the

I was told that the whole tale was told to a friend, who was at home in his room reading. I went up to him, and found him sitting up in bed, with a piece of paper on his lap, and a pen in his hand. He was reading, and I got up and asked him if he had read it; but he replied that he had not. I asked him if he had seen anything, and he said that he had not.

_6 September._--Spoke to Van Helsing, as usual, and found him somewhat restless, and asked him all sorts of questions. He said that he was going to London, and was coming to Havre to call in the police. I asked him why he was coming, and he answered:--

"I want to get a piece of paper, and to write all over again; and to get it I must have a typewriter, in which case I shall be able to write in shorthand. I have some men with me who can do this work for me." I told him that I understood that shorthand was very useful to shorthand writers, but that, in my opinion, it was but a rarefied air that was suitable for a man of his age and station. He answered:--

"Oh, I know! I know! But I can't do it. I don't know what it is, but I don't think I am strong enough now! I must be much stronger than I used to be before; and, besides, I can't write like that. I used to be good enough to write shorthand, but I can't write it now, and I can't write it well. I used to be good enough, but I am no more; and if I write good shorthand, I shall write good English, and write good English well. I shall write it all in shorthand, and I shall write it all in shorthand well; and then I shall be happy." I asked him if he would give me any instructions in shorthand, as I wished to write it all out exactly. He answered:--

"Yes, I will tell you what you must do, and I will tell you how." I went away

_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_19 June._--When I met Mrs. Harker at the post-office I found her in a worse humour than before. Her husband was not at home, and so, with tears in her eyes, she went to him. His voice was low and weak as she spoke to him:--

"Jonathan, I am so sorry. I know it is hard for you; but let the world not tell you that, for it is not so. You must know, my dear, that you are making all the difference, and that all will not be well. I took the first step towards you, and I was afraid that you would have helped me; but I must have had it our good that we should lose; for when I told you that we were to cut our way through enemy lines, you did not aid me, but rebelled. I am sorry to say that I shall never be so free from the fear of losing you again. If there is anything to be done, I shall do it; and you are to be my most faithful friend. I have told you to be strong, and you have done it; you have your husband with you, and we are safe--safe in your arms."

Everything was ready, and Dr. Seward was waiting. He was a man of great energy, and a rare energy for his age and condition. I had been to see him once before, at Waterloo, and felt that he was in some ways the most complete scientist I had ever known. He told me that he had had, as a boy, a close and interesting and very serious experience; but that it had not been long since he had acted on it.

"I remember," he said, "when I was a boy, who was then in his seventeenth year, the joys of life. I was a prisoner in the British Museum, my only connection with the outside world, and I was working, as I used to act, on the new phonograph, which enabled me to read even the most minute of books. One day, as I was reading one, I noticed something strange; the pages glowed. I knew then that the light in books was not only the same as
====================
Early in the morning of Saturday, July 25, I had an interview with a man named Thomas Beil, who was a solicitor, and who is very well known in the business. He is in charge of the American branch of the firm, and he is one of the most genial men I ever met with. He has been a solicitor in the city of London for twenty years, and has decently known all the different forms of business in the capital. He is a very amiable, good-natured, and easy-going man, and I found him very cordial and friendly. He is a very intelligent man, and is in good standing in the law school at London College. He is, I should like to see, very skillful in law, and I think he has an excellent knowledge of public and of private affairs. He is as good a man as you will find anywhere in this country, and I am sure that he will cheer you up, and will not only help you, but will help you, in your own way.

"He was a little over a hundred when he came to London. He has not grown old, but is full of vigour. He is a very fit man, with good lungs, and a great sense of humour, and a good mind. He has been married for twenty-four years to the lady who is his present wife, and they have four children. They have a very fine home, and have a good husband and a good schoolmaster. He writes from Haddonfield, and has a house in West Street, that is very pretty. He is a very hearty, good-humoured man. His first book was a very good one on the law, and I think it is a very good one for a solicitor. I hope the American will read it, and I shall be glad to have it. I shall look at it with interest; it is full of good facts. I beseech you to let me know if he is or is not thoroughly acquainted with the law here."

"Certainly," said the Professor.

As I have said, Mr. Hasker is a very good and learned man; but he is only the first of many.

The next morning, I drove to St. Mary's Churchyard. I was anxious to make my visit as soon as possible, as I wanted to see Van Helsing and the Count himself the next morning
====================
A lot of people seem to think that this book is a true story.

Well, I can't tell you how many times I have heard this put into words,
and yet I have never read it, and never will. It is a
terrible thing to think of such an unhappy end. I am so glad that
I have read this book, for, if it is a true story, it must be a
terrible one. I have read so many dreadful things that I know
it must be true. I understand that there is a monster in the house
and that there is a monster in the house, and that the monster is
getting stronger and stronger. I am going to go and see him, and
shall write to my correspondent if I hear anything. I don't like to
think of the terrible things that are going on; but I must not think of
them. If it is true, they are terrible, and the only thing to do is
to write them down in a journal.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing came in late, and we went into the
study together after dinner. All the Professor knew of his visit to me
was that he wanted to see me, and that he wanted to go away. I
got him a chair, and he sat down at once. He began:--

"Now, how is Mina? She is in excellent spirits, and looking very
happy. I was afraid that if I had not gone to see you that she was in
terrible straits; but I am glad that she is so. I am not sorry for
her that she has suffered; but it is not right that she should suffer.
God help her. Let her suffer! Let her suffer!"

"What do you want from me?" I asked. "Tell me what it is that you
want, and I will do it."

"I want you to give me a kiss. I want you to kiss me, and I
will do as you say."

"I will do as you say. I love you, my dear, and I forgive you.
But I want you to make me kiss it, with all the
====================
Love story

In September last year, two young people, Pankaj and Anil, from Haryana's Puri district, came to us. Anil is a young man of 29 or 30. He is a student of law at the Western Law University.

They had just left Puri by bus, and had been staying in a house on the edge of a dike. The dike was being pulled down, and the house had been destroyed; but fortunately the house where they had stayed had escaped without trouble.

The young people, with no difficulty, asked us to come and stay with them for a day at their house on the edge of the dike. This, of course, was a favour to them, and they were all eager to see us.

As there was some work to be done in the morning, we decided to go down to the river, and take a boat to the place where their house stood.

When we got to the edge of the dike, we found the house had been completely destroyed. The whole of the brickwork had been knocked down, and the roof, wall and window had been blown in. And yet the house was intact, and the owner, a man of medium height and far too old to have been a student, was able to give us his address.

The owner, who had been a student of over 30 years, had been trying to buy the place, but had been unable to, for he had been unable to find anyone willing to sell. He had then, however, sold the house to a foreigner, and was now attempting to purchase it again.

The young men all smiled, and said that they would be very happy to see us, and that they would be glad to see us again. We laughed, and said that it was quite routine for them to come to us for help. They were very friendly and sweet-natured people, and we felt that we had come at the end of a very interesting adventure.

When we got into the house, there was an old man in the neighbourhood, who was ably assisted to his room by a man in his forties, and a young man in his forties.

They told us where they could find some money, and that, as they had been trying to buy the house, they had had difficulty.

"The owner of the house has gone down
====================
It was a quick, simple, and very effective way of getting the message over the airwaves.

At the end of three days of exciting travel, we had almost achieved our
object. We had made a much-needed and important first step in our
plan to find out what had been done at Bergen. The big news was
being written home from London, and we could go back to our own
country and look up the facts--if we only took the time.

When we had succeeded in reading the official papers, we had to go
back to the coast to speak to the British Government.

The first thing they asked was: "What really happened?"

This seemed an open and easy task to us. We said that we were the
British Government and that, as we had been here, we were interested in what
had happened. They evidently felt that the matter contained in those
pages of official papers was of considerable importance. They said:--
"You will find it a privilege to ask questions, for we have examined
all the facts and come to the same conclusions as you."

This was quite true--quite right. We had been here, and had a right
to ask questions. But it was not the same thing with the Government,
which had been here before us. They treated us as if we were
interviewers. They treated us as if we were interrogators, and tried
to force us with questions into all sorts of details. They treated us
as if we were policemen, inquisitors, and interrogators. "All facts
necessary to our determination," they said, in a manner which suggested
that they were prepared to use every means at hand to secure them. I
f you had been asked to give an account of your experiences by the
British Government, you would, I suppose, have to answer "all
facts necessary to their determination." This is what the gentleman
who asked the question at Westminster called "the law."

It was a curious thing that this law should be so little concerned with
the matters of reality, and so much concerned with the details of
the legend. When we had been speaking to British officers in the
Helsing Museum, and had got them to give us the newspapers which
had been sent, they were so eager to get down whatever they could to the
British Government, that

_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_29 September._--I must have been dreaming, for I must have fallen asleep,
for the next thing I remember is waking up. I need not tell you how much
thank God I am for it! I have got a sort of knowledge of the room in which
he was sleeping, and I know what he wanted. It was some time, perhaps
two or three hours, before I could remember again. If I had been dreaming,
I should have amaze you all to your chagrin with my knowledge and my
knowledge. I have got so much of his life, and so many strange tortures
and horrors, that I shall tell you them all now, so that you may not be
bewildered. Here is everything that I know:--

and that a red ooze was coming out of them. I know that
====================
I tried to reason with him, but he would not listen. He was mad, and I could not help feeling that the rest of the world was mad with him. He was a monster! And yet, there was something in him which made me feel that he was doing some good. He told me that he was going to buy my house. He said that he would use me as a sort of agitator, and that he would make me an example. He would beat me with a stick, and I would, he said, avoid the blood-thirsty man. I was aghast, and I said that if he wanted to buy my house he would have to pay me the money he asked. He looked at me with a look of astonishment which he had never shown before, and said, with a laugh:--

"How can you know the value of a piece of ground, when you have not a penny to buy?"

I tried to think of some way of getting myself out of the matter, but I could not think of anything. I suppose it was because I was so tired that I did not think of anything.

The next morning Van Helsing came up to the room where we were sitting, and he seemed very surprised when he saw what I had done. He said:--

"What do you mean, 'got a stick to beat you with'?"

"Myself and a friend of mine have bought your house, and we are going to use it as an example of why you may not deal youself harm with others. We have done some work, and we shall be off, and when we are gone you shall take what you will with you. But first you must promise me not to use violence in your house till we have paid."

"What, promise me to buy my house?"

"Yes, promise."

"But I don't want to buy any house; I don't want to purchase any property!"

"I dare not promise to purchase property. You may as well think of that as to purchase a house."

"I don't want to purchase a house, and I don't want to own any house!"

"Then you must promise not to use violence in your house!"

"It is only a promise! Then you will promise not to use violence in your house!"

"But, I don

He's only 12, but he already knows what it's like to be a child again.
This one, in the bath, is the most pathetic. He's so small, and his face is pale and
whiter. He doesn't even seem to notice, because he doesn't even flinch, like
me. I know it's the bathwater, because I was once in it.

It made me so angry, though, when I heard the woman in the bathtubs
talking. She must have heard the others, for she went and looked at
him and said, in a low, childish voice. "He's just beginning to grow!"

I can't help feeling that she is under the influence of some narcotic, for
and I do mean and intend to use it--so the next thing I know, the
room is empty. I shiver with fear and uneasiness, for there is no way
that a child could have been in the bath.

I've been thinking of death a good deal since my last rest. I knew then
that my time was coming, but I was afraid. Death is often a fearful thing,
and when it comes, I know that I must go mad. I fear to think, and I
don't like to think. That's why I've been thinking of death a lot lately.
I know that it is coming, and that I must not oppose it. I am getting
further and further away from the Count, and I am afraid that, if I keep
up my present pace, I shall never reach him. If I keep on at the present
rate I shall reach him in a few days, and then he shall have made as
sure of my destruction as I have done of his. I know that I may be
defeated, and yet I must not lose heart. The Count knows that I am his,
and he knows that I am going mad. He may even help me, for I know that
he has no heart of my own; he has only my brain. And if I fail, he
will have failed me. If I die before the Count is destroyed, then I shall
fail him alone. If I die before him, then I shall succeed in the end.
And if I die before both of us, I shall have done my part. You must believe

"We are doing our utmost to help and are working well together. I should like to see you soon, and promise to return to-morrow."

She had been speaking of a certain Professor Quincey Morris, of the London Zoological Gardens, a very promising zoölogist, and of the work on which his life was to be centred. Lord Godalming, who was with us at the hotel, was on the point of taking the opportunity of saying a few words, but his voice seemed to have lost its ring.

"I shall see you soon, friend John," he said. "My wife and I are waiting for you."

He took my hand in mine and led us out into the hall. "This is a pretty place," he remarked. "There are trees and flowers all about you, and you are all so close to the sun. We shall be happy here, and we shall have a happy life together."

It was a happy life. I felt so happy, too, for I felt that in our close presence, which seemed to take its place beside the others, the Professor was saying to me:--

"I see you, and you see me. What is it that you desire? What is it which you fear? What is it which you seek?"

"I want to live."

"Well! then, I shall help you; I shall help you to live, for you are my friend and I shall help you."

"So much the better! You shall be my friend, and I shall always be with you."

We had a long talk together. I was glad that he had not married me, and so I had no reason to be afraid of him. I felt very happy--and somewhat sad, for I knew that Lucy was close at hand.

When the Professor had gone, he said to me:--

"Friend John, I know that you are anxious about me, and that you are striving to do what is right. I pray you that you will forgive me--for I did wrong--and that when I come to you I may forgive you, too; and that you will forgive me! Oh, my friend John, I promise you, if I can only go and see you."

"You must not do so."

"What do you mean?"

In the morning people came to the square and found the whole place empty. The people who had been there at once ran off into the town, and the old woman, who had been doing her duty, went to the inn, where she stayed a while. Then, after a little pause, she came back, and told us that, since the day of her arrival, the square had been empty. Then she started and said that in one of her dreams a man had been standing just outside the gate of the churchyard, and that she had seen in the castle-window a young man come out, which she supposed meant that the man who had passed the gate at the hour of the crucifixion was coming out again.

We all gathered round and looked, and found that the man had been the young lady. She was strangely weak, her face was ghastly white, and the lips were white and withered.

We all went on in a sort of helpless horror, and prayed for her; but the old woman was the first to speak.

"I have been praying," she said. "For three nights and three days alone. I have had no rest since that night, for the clouds and the rain and the tempests have kept me awake all day. I have not eaten or drunk since the night before, for I have not sleep since the crucifixion. When I am awake I cannot sleep, for the windows are all shut, and the moon is dark. I am in despair, and I cannot think. I cannot sleep; and I am in fear, for the night is coming on us all at once, and we are all alone."

"And you think that you are going to die?" asked Van Helsing.

"No, my dear Madam Mina; I do not think so. I am not afraid of death. I am afraid that some terrible thing may come upon me, and that I shall be powerless to stop it. I have thought of death, and I have feared it. I have even thought of coming to the very limit of my sanity, and perhaps of coming to the very edge of it, and being destroyed or taken from me. Do you think that I am not afraid?"

"Then you are mad!" said Van Helsing. "You are mad, and you are poor!"

"I am not afraid of death," she said; "

_Mina Harker's Journal._

_28 October._--We arrived at Whitby at sunset, and found the
Count gone from the castle. He had taken his abode in the churchyard
of St. Mary's, where he had risen on the day before we left.
I asked Mr. Renfield if he had seen him, for I had heard that he was
an eccentric and eccentric at his best. He answered:--

"I can't tell you anything for fear of prejudice, Miss Lucy, but I
can tell you this: that he is dead. I dare say that in a few hours
he will be as much a ghost as the churchyard is."

I have now a sort of suspicion about me, and the more so that
I am writing from the front. I fear to look abroad; so I have
placed all my letters in my bag. I shall write home before the
sunset comes on.

The travel has been a disaster. I have had to run from home, and
have had to avoid the Count's castle. I am afraid to go to
London, for the sisters are ill, and the roads are dangerous. I am
diary-keeping, and it is quite a task, and I am afraid. I shall
write as soon as I get home, for if I do not I shall be terribly
heart-broken.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_29 October._--I have been thinking. I must write early, for if I
do not I shall be terribly heart-broken; for if I do not now it will
be terribly hard to bear. I have not seen the Count since he was
dressed in his formal attire on the morning of his entry into
the house through the churchyard into the courtyard. I have been
playing at pantomime, for I feel that if I did not I should be utterly
lost. I am not tired, and I am not sleepy. I have

"What are you doing here?"

"I have come to see the King."

"What do you mean?"

"I am going to the Castle--"

"Oh, no, no, no, no. You must not go. You will have to stay. I must keep watch over you."

"What are you talking about?"

"I am staying. I am staying with you, for I am afraid you may not come."

"Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to go away."

"Then Mr. Renfield will not come; and if he does he will not come alone."

"That is only for the time. I shall stay with you. I shall stay with you so long as there is a soul in this world."

"Then I shall go with you; for you are safe here?"

"I tell you so, for I know what must happen to me if I should go away."

"Come, then; I shall go with you. Come, let us go to the Castle."

I knew that I must not go without the hope of safety, so I gladly assented.

We went into the room, and in the corridor I found her sleeping soundly. I opened the door, and seeing that she was still asleep, opened the door and tried to wake her.

She turned over, and, as I bent down, said with a happy smile:--

"Come here, my sweet; I am all right."

She patted my head, and said:--

"I am always so sleepy!"

"Come here, you are so sweet. I can feel you under my fingers." With a quick movement she grasped my hand, and with a smile she pulled me into the room.

I lay down on the sofa, and she went to the lamp and lit a small fire. I followed her, and she said to me:--

"Come, let us have a nice cold night, and then we can all be asleep. You can lie on the sofa and I can sleep as best I like in my room. When the time comes I shall wake you." I went to my room, and after a little time she said to me:--

"Come, let us go to bed; you will foam all

I need to thank you for the excellent service.


It is a pleasure to receive your message.


When the steamboat arrived at Kettleness, we had a talk over the particulars of our arrival.

The whole thing seemed quite simple and straightforward, and we all agreed that
it would be the most satisfactory way of getting to London from here. We
cannot, of course, quite believe the legend that you have made up, for
it is not the case, and it is, I am sure, not from the most accurate
method. I could not find a single record of any vessel coming here before
and, as I know, from the dead tongues of the peoples who have written,
"all the ships that have passed are never heard of again." I do not, I
think, understand the whole story, and I am always so amazed at the
gloss of invented facts, that I feared that my inquiry might
cause much upset.

I came here to look for my wife, and I did not find her. I am so sorry,
though it was all in the best of faith, that I cannot bring myself to tell
you, or even to mention the matter to any one else. I have written a letter

so much. I must have read it, for I have not seen you for a
week. You told me that you were quite ready to start on the
voyage, and I shall send for some money. If I find any of our
friends in the country with money-changers, I shall let them know
you are coming. You must, I hope, get there as soon as you can.

You must proceed on the road of discovery, with the utmost

_Mina Murray's Journal._

_19 September._--I must have read Van Helsing's letter, and
thought it'd be a nice story to have him tell. So I wrote him
up, and he's on it. When I got home I was busy with the
letters; and when I got to the end of them, there was the signature of
Mina Murray's father on page here, and his signature on page there.
I knew I'd done something wrong, so I sent a telegram to the
post office, as I always do when something goes wrong, and asked
if I could add her father's signature to the letters. The man
was a big, hard-faced old fellow, with a big white moustache
and a big glass face, and he looked at me very gravely when he
saw the letters. He told me that he had only added the names of
the letters as a sort of caution, and that he wouldn't do it again,
and then he went on in a very poignantly serious way about letters and

====================
I have been writing this in the sunroom of my own house, where I have a window open to the air. I can see the whole of London through the window, and, in fact, see so much of it, that I have been able to do what I have been thinking about. I have come to the conclusion that people are not so ignorant as they seem to be of the world; that they know things which they do not themselves know; and that this ignorance is, if not the sole cause, at least a root of its evils. I have been reading the papers, and I am glad to say that the whole subject is being thoroughly considered. It is becoming of man to accept certain truths, and to accept others as necessary to his existence; but if the former accept them in ignorance, the latter have no right to reject them.

I have been trying to get some idea of the population of London. I was able to get some information from the census of 1869, as it was sent to me by a friend. The result is as follows:--

"The population of London in 1869 was
1,330,860."

I found it easy to arrange with a friend of Mrs. Henshaw's, Professor Van Helsing, to purchase the necessary papers. We will here enter on what we have to say on the subject, and proceed as follows:--

"In the census of 1869, the Guide Board gave the population of London,
in thousands, as at the close of the last census. The result was, in
determining the population, the following figures were taken:--

1868, 6,846,731.

1869, 7,075,825.


"In the first year of our present King's life, the
surplus population of London, after the expiry of the first ten
years, was 7,104,015.

so very clever, that she had not the heart to
put forward such a request, so she replied:--

"Friend, will you let me suckle the Count?"

_19 May_.--We met at the station. "May we come in?"
We waited on the Count. He came as quietly as
he could, and arrived in the carriage. He was much
expressed, and very courteous, and said:--

"I am afraid, my dear, that it may not be possible. I have
been away three weeks, and my wife is very ill. She cannot
bear to see me, and she can hardly bear to see her friend. I
will be happy at home, and, if you will excuse me, I shall
come to-night." He bowed, and said:--

"I am glad that you will come, my dear; but I dare not
leave the Count here for an hour. I shall go away and
sleep. I must not miss the train; and if I do not arrive
before nine o'clock, I shall be all right. Come, let us go."

We went to the house, and found that the Count was
quite well, and was making merry when we entered. He
said to me at once:--

"My dear, I am so glad that you will be here. I never
expected to see you, and yet I am so happy. I'm so glad that
you will come. I could not have gone to-night unless you had
said you would come. I was afraid to-night; but I am so glad
now that you will come. I knew then that you would come; but
you must go to-night, for you can come again if you wish. I shall
come to-morrow, and shall see you over the

_17 September._--I find that I am able to remember things, though
sometimes with a difficulty which may not be altogether congenial. I
have not read since the first day of the month, so far as I can tell,
A History of the World, or _Transcriber's Note_. When I have read it,
I have found it to be quite a valuable work, and I shall read it more
carefully than ever.





Mrs. Harker's Diary._at the Court of Viscount Harker._

_19 September._--When I got to the house, I found that all was ready;
but there was no note of any kind in the hall.

When I went to the dining-room I found Fanny waiting for me,
and she looked very red and sad-looking. I went into the room, and
found her sitting up in her seat, leaning over, and with a look of
repulsion on her face. She said:--

"Oh, my dear, oh, my God, my God! I have such a fright, I wish I could
run away from this place! I cannot believe what I am seeing. I
dare not go any further than the door, where I heard a dog howl; I
can hear the rats howling in the hall outside." I could hear her
diary, which was lying on her breast, go back and forth, as it was
written:--

"We are on the other side of the wall; we are close to where the
door of the church is." I could hear her quiet breathing, as she
read.

"I can't believe what I am seeing either, because it seems to me that
the place is full of souls, or at any rate of dead ones, as the
dust flies. I can't believe that there are bodies to be seen, and that
there are many of them
====================
A juror has been struck off the bench in a case where his evidence may have been prejudicial. He was on duty at the time of the banking crash of 1929. He was called as a witness by a solicitor representing the bank. He was asked by him as to the amount of money in the accounts of the two banks in question. He replied that he could not say as he was not there at the time. The solicitor then asked him if he had any reason for doubting his statement. The answer was in the negative.

It was reported at the time, but not yet again, that this particular lack of belief may have been of some historical interest.

I ask, not for an individual, but for the good of the cause.

His answer may be used to good purpose.

A new look at the evidence

So much for the original question, did the evidence change after the bank crash? Again, limited to the times when the calls were made, there was a general change in the manner in which the evidence was given. The official papers were read out at the trial; the jury were asked to read them out to them. The official papers were read:

"Some weeks since, whilst in the house of Messrs. C. H. and M. H., in Wallasey, the home of the late Hon. John H. Seward, we were called as to the money in the accounts of the two banks. Mr. and Mrs. Seward were the owners of the two banks, and the books and records of their respective offices were of general use.

"It is evident, from the general description given, that the money in the accounts was, like that of the Hon. Mr. Seward, of London. The bank at which we were called, and which we visited and which was, at the time, the life and soul of the Hon. Seward's house, was in the general neighbourhood of the bank at which we were. We were told that, in addition to the Mr. Seward's money, there was a considerable sum of money belonging to other people, and that we were directed to return it to the old man. We were told that we should be given £5 to-night, and that we should be able to get £10 on the day of the trial. We were to be given a receipt for the money, signed by the solicitor of
====================
and there was in the
dawn the presence of the angels that I had heard
spoken of; and the angel, by whom I had been thus
forewarned, said to me:--

"Say, my child, that you are before me. I am the sun, and
I have come to show you the way to the other stars. Look!"
And he beckoned me to look.

As I held up the light from my eye, and looked, I saw
the face of the blessed John, with his mouth open, and his
ears pointed. The angel said to me:--

"Now then, my child, you will tell me all the secrets of the
unseen. There is much that you are not yet to learn. And
before long you will want to ask me questions that I cannot answer.
But do not fear, my child, for I shall answer all you ask me,
and I shall show you what wonders are wrought in sleep. If
all is well, we shall meet again in the morning, and I shall tell
you all that I know."

So we parted, and I went to look for Van Helsing, and found
him in his room, reading a book with a pencil in his hand. He
said not a word to me, but lay down with his eyes shut.

The next morning, when I opened the window, I found him sleeping,
and with one ear open. He said nothing, but sat up in bed and
watched. I knew then what he wanted to tell me; I went down and
fumbled about for a letter, but found none. I went out and knocked at
the door, and when I opened it, there was Van Helsing standing in his
room, looking down at me. I knew then that he wanted to tell me; so I
went up to him, and gave him the letter, and with it hid the box
in my hand.

"Friend John," I said, "you have told me all you know. You
know of the Count's coming, and of his coming with it. You know that in
the morning he will be triumphant over his enemies and triumph over
them all, for that which he loves the world loves; that his enemies
will be swept away by his irresistible power, and that the world will

CHAPTER XXIV.

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY.

_4 September._--Friend Jonathan said to me:--

"Renfield, I am glad you are well, for I am afraid that if I were yourself I should not feel well enough to write to you. I have suffered from certain ills, and am not at all comfortable. I have read your Diary, and I know that you have suffered from the same malady. It is hard for me to believe that it is you who have been so busy, and that your mind was occupied with a matter of this sort. I should think, too, that you must have been anxious lest I should not be able to read it all over again."

"Do not be so angry with me," he said, "but I am afraid I must speak out of turn. I am a young man, and my attention is weak. It is hard for me to believe that I have done wrong, though it is so! I feel sure that if it had been a man who did it who did it whom you were angry at, you would not have been angry at him. I am not ready to believe it, so I must not believe it. I can only forget--for I do not want to remember it, either. To-day I have read your Diary, and I am glad that you have not forgotten it, for I do not think that it is so bad as I suppose."

"I must not forget it," I said, "and you must not forgive me. I shall read it all again, and when I do I shall write to you. But I must not forget, for you must not forget. Your Diary, that is all; it is yours, and you must not destroy it." He was so kind to me that I did not feel like speaking, so I only said:--

"I thank you, my dear sir, for your kind words, and I shall do my best to see that you do not suffer from any malady of the brain." He said that was so, and went away. I have had a terrible headache all day

One More Thing

I found out that the Professor is even more desperate than I expected.
He has a search party of four men, with white coats, and much
more armed. They are going to London to find out the owner of the
box. They want to make an immediate arrest.

The papers are full of details of how they are to get to the King's
Welcome. The Count and the Countess have an official motor coach, and
are on their way to the station. I am to be on it, and have been for
several weeks. I am sure I shall be useful. I have seen the place
before, and the train is always on time. Do not be afraid. You are safe, and
you are free.

Take care.

_Later._--My dear Arthur,--

"When you are ready, you will write me. I have hoped for such a
letter. I do not even write to myself. I feel sure that you will
favour me. You are sane, and have been for many weeks; but I
can trust you. You are young and strong, and I believe in you. I
know that you are not mad. I trust that you will do good, and that
God will bless you, and that good may last for ever. I do not know
what I shall write, for I fear that the very thought would upset
you. I shall write now, for it is the time to do so. I shall write
not of all things, but only of this one, and that only, and
I shall write it in shorthand; and then I shall send it to you.
It is a script, a shorthand, of some sort, of a shorthand of
something; I have copied it out, and shall keep it for many years to
study. It is very simple; but it is true, and it may save your
life; for I swear to you that I

Cyrus' lips, which had been set firmly into a line, now began to curve upwards, as though he were striving to draw out a breath.

The Professor kept his eyes fixed on him, and grimaced. His attention was drawn to the Professor, and he remembered what his friend said about him.

"My friend," he said, "you only use the blood. Oh, you must learn not only to use the blood of men, but to use the blood of God himself!"

"Then," said the Professor, "I have not done my duty."

"But you have not done it well!"

"I could not have done it better! God knows I must do it better than I." He looked puzzled for a moment, but the strain of his illness had made him a little more stooped before his questioner.

"But then," he said, soothingly, "you do not want to know, do you, my friend?"

"No!"

"Why? Do you not know that much knowledge is more precious than undecipherable words? Do you not know that? Do you not know that even the key to a lock is more precious than the word 'abstraction'?"

"I do not know," he said. "I have no idea of 'abstraction,' thank God! I mean only this: that I should be able to know."

He had not yet said anything to the Professor, but it was evident that he was distressed at this. He held up his hand, and the Professor drew it back.

"You are not yet quite ready for the questioner," he said. "I would like you to begin, in the words of our old friend Jonathan Swift: 'When I ask a man's mind, I do not expect to learn anything new. I only want to know what he is thinking.' "

"Professor," said Van Helsing, after a pause, "I do not think you mean it unless you mean that I have no right to ask your mind; and I do not, for I know not what I ask."

"Then you can tell me, and I shall know?"

"I am not asking your mind about anything. I ask it simply because I want to know what you think."

"Good."

"Then I go on asking myself:
====================
"There is a need for this in the East," I said. "Must there be to-morrow?"

"There will be," he answered. "But what is it?"

"To-morrow, I suppose."

"What is it?"

"To-morrow, I suppose, an inquest into the loss of your dear mother."

"To-morrow, I suppose!"

"Then, come then, and we can discuss it. You will join me here on Sunday, when I can see more fully."

"All right; all right!" I was so eager to get away that I said:
"But what shall we do? what shall we do?"

"We must be on our guard," he answered. "If you are not with us to-day, then there is work to be done and no one to do it for you. So that you may not fear, I have told you all. But we must be on our guard; for if we do not work together, then the enemy may be free to do what he will. He may then take you, if he find you in the East, and have you only as his own. For, if you come to me, you will not fear, for I have already told you all. I know your fears, my friend John, and I know your fears well; and yet oh, my friend John, I fear none. What then is this in the East? Is it the will of the Almighty to send you to be our doom? No! it is but his will, and there is no other. To-day we must work to the end. When you have told me all, we shall have an easy task to hand. But first, I must go to Cæsarea and get your father. I know that he is away, and that might make him unhappy; but I must go to him and ask him to come to us when he returns. Then we can be with him in the midst of all our troubles. Then you, too, can come to me when peace is won. Then we may talk and act for the good of the whole race."

I felt very sad as I listened to these words. I wondered at his goodness and pity; and yet, in the end, I felt that I was holding him to a great and terrible responsibility. He was the first man to whom
====================
left, then the number of the days, and the number of the hours,
in hours, and minutes, and seconds: what is this which I seek? I
cannot know it, for it is beyond my knowledge, nor can I tell you.

"But I know that you were with me the day the ship went out. We were
left to die together. It is we who shall die alone to-day.

"May it be that by our death our souls may live to see the day when
all may be for the good of men, and that we all die without stain."

The inquest was concluded with the following report:--

"The cause of death given was as follows, viz.--Death of Van Helsing, from
sudden asphyxiation, with head and neck in a concussion, face bled,
brain and spinal cord and heart and lungs and spleen and lungs and
gut and other parts of body missing.

"The manner of death given was as follows, viz., by a straight
cut from the neck down to the base of the ribcage, and from the base of
the sternum down to the left side of the neck. The throat was then
taken by the hair, and the body lying face down, with the head
placed back over the heart and the throat taken in the same manner.

"Of the four wounds mentioned, one was of the left foot, and the other two
of the right, and the last of both was of the throat. The wound of
the head was made to the head by a piece of the hard leathern collar worn by
the men, which was pulled up over the mouth with the left hand, and the
neck by the right. The nails were of the white leaden, and the
thickest of them was a leaden plug of lead; the other was an iron one,
and the last was of iron. The nail in the left foot was a two-inch
stamp, and the nail on the right was a three-inch one.

"The corpse was in a deplorable state, for all the internal imperfections
were shown. The face was turned towards the right, with the eyes
closed, the nose and mouth arched back, and the lips curved back. The
mouth was full, and the gashes

====================
"There is a power in you which cannot be mastered by brute force. You know that. You know, too, that it is the key to your freedom. But, Madam Mina, what is that key?

"It is this: I am not a slave; I have chosen this life. I have chosen to become the master of my life. I do not choose to be satisfied with the condition of those who came before me. I choose to become the master who will lead them to freedom.

"And now, Madam Mina, the time has come. I command you now to take and to use this key which you hold so dear. And then, you and I, and all who love us, shall be free!"

I could see now that he was very serious. I could see that he was about to break down and to throw up his hands in despair.

"I do not know," he said, "how to obey." I could see that he was beginning to understand. We could all see that something was wrong.

"You do not know," he said, "how to fear. You do not know, or can you imagine, the terrors of that terrible night that you must have felt. It is true that you know how to fear death--though you know not that fear to be death. But death is fear; and death is fear to live. Fear to die--that is the key to life. To die is to be not only not alive but to cease to be. You can not learn that fear till you fear it, and learn it not till you know it. You can learn not to fear death till you can die not to be. To fear not to die is the key to life. To fear not to die is the key to freedom.

"There is no key that is not a key; all are keys, if you but know what they are. Tell me, my child, what key is this. Tell me what you know, that this very night may rest from your terror, which is at stake. Tell me, my child, how you can, in the knowledge that this very night is to end in your freedom.

"You can save your life, and yet die to-day; and as you can die to-day, so you can save all life, and so die free.

"And so,
====================
Lucy and I arrived at Varna at noon, and met the Count at the station. We were all very anxious about him, and so it was that he asked us all to sit down; we all did so, and he began to tell me all that had happened.

When he had finished, a gentleman in a white carriage came up to us, and said:--

"The Count has left for Varna in an hour's time. He will be in the Carfax, and will be in the station some time after."

"Good!" I said, "I shall be with you all the way." The gentleman in the white carriage departed, and I went to the window.
Lucy and I were so excited at the news that we both jumped up and down, and in a piteous way ran off to meet the Count.
The instant we were near he stopped, and said:--

"Ah, my dear, my dear! You must hurry, and wait!"

"What is it?" I asked, for I was not well used to such a thing.

He looked at me intently for a moment, then said:--

"You must hurry--you must wait."

"How?" I asked.

"To-morrow afternoon, if you can, and then to your own heart's content."

"Then I shall wait!" I said.

"You shall!" he answered, and with that he took me into his carriage and disappeared away.
As we were in the midst of the station, Lucy looked out of the window, and saw the Count's carriage pull up in the town.
Lucy is one of those pretty girls who can write pretty much anywhere, and we all went into the library to look up the letter in Van Helsing's diary. We must have read it, for the Professor opened it and read:--

"Last night at eight o'clock, at the hour of sunset, I went to the little inn in the churchyard.
The door was shut, but the maitre d' had gone out, and the moonlight streamed in through the
window, casting its rays over the freshly fallen leaves of the oak. When I came in,
I saw the nurse, who had just come in, sitting on the bed, and she was smiling, for
she was having a
====================
CHAPTER IX

THE DIARY

I was awakened by the
knocking at the house, which was only
somewhat muffled by the
dust. I got up and went to the room where
the maid was, who had no door, but had, as I saw, a
big key in her hand. She was sitting on the bed, and
had her knees bent, as though she were kneeling. As I entered
the room, I noticed that the door was barred, and that
a heavy bag was securely fastened round the neck of the
maid. I went away to look at the bag, but found that it
was tight, and the bag had been thrown over it. There was no
reason for it, for the bag, as I had seen on the
blackboard, had been tied round the neck with a piece of
wire, and was fastened by a screw to the back of the neck. I
went back to the room and looked in the door, and found it
unlocked. I went to the door myself, but found it not
locked. When I went to the room where the maid was, I found
that she was not in the room. I went to the door, and found that
there was no one in it. I went into the room and found that
the night-dress was drawn back, and that the key had been
stuffed in its place. I went into the room, and found the room
full of flies; they were in a multitude of ways, and in
many different places. After a while I went round, and found that
there was no one in the room. I began to panic, for the whole
feel of things was changing, and that the coming of the Count
might bring with it at least a change in my situation. I
saw that I was in for a fright, for I had not the heart
to go on. I put on my coat, and went out to the door. I
escaped through a door on the back of the bed, where the bag
of wire had been thrown, and I came into the room. The maid was
knocking. I knocked, and she answered me as I had knocked, and
asked who it was that she had to call at. I told her that I
was coming; so she called, and I came in

====================
To the Editor:

The article "The Un-Dead Woman" by the London correspondent of the "Times" is an excellent work and I am glad that it has been produced, for it shows the wonderful power of imagination in the face of the facts.

A hundred years ago, when the poor, bitter still-born were being torn from their parents' arms, and when the red death was reanimated by the powers of the terrible "Vampire"
hung over London like a statue of Un-Dead Mother, there was a popular belief that the poor dead could be turned to
blood in such cases. That belief was, however, crushed long ago, for, even when
recently revived, the poor dead are not apt to be moved to blood-satisfaction by the
craving of their young owners. In fact, the blood-scenting power of a vampire
must be much greater than that of any living being, since the dead are at the
least as apt as the living, and sometimes more so, to excite the dead to blood-scent
among themselves.

There is, however, a more recent belief which we are to consider in
order to explain why the dead, as well as the living, have been turned to
blood-scent. This belief was prevalent in some Eastern and Oriental,
as well as in the Christian West, and is still held by some as true. The
faith in the immortality of the soul was, however, not universally
accepted; and for a long time it was doubted whether the dead could be
transmuted to blood. The great Professor of Vampireology Dr.
Jonathan Harker, of the London School of Hygiene and
Dead, has since shown that there is no such transfusion to be had in
human nature; and the belief in it was, as he says, "out of
the realm of reason." The belief concerning the immortality of the
soul was generally repudiated by the scientists of the day, who, in view of
the facts before them, could not but feel that the immortality of the
dead was in no way to be doubted. By following the
paths of science, however, we may find a way of knowing, and, if possible, a
correspondence between the belief of our own day and the facts of
life and death. We

10 September, 7:35 a. m.

Mrs. Harker.

It is so wonderful to me, Harker; you have been so kind to me in the
last few days.

I am so glad that the Count is leaving me all alone. It seems to me that
there is something wrong with me; my blood is not right. I have had
some terrible dreams last night, and there was a sort of ghastly-looking
thing looking at me through the window. I got up and looked out, and the
window was open; it was that of an owl, and I could see the silver
wings fluttering. I ran out of the room and called for my husband, but
he was out of the room by the time I got there. Then I could hear
dark footsteps coming from the bedroom door, and the door swung open
just a crack. Then the thing came in and whispered to me, but I
could not make out its voice. It was a spell, and I was unconscious; it
took my husband's hand and led him down the passage between the
two rooms and down the hall. I was just able to follow, and I
saw that the window had been broken. I heard the door close
behind them, and they were gone. I thought that I might go down
into the drawing-room, where there was a light, and look out, for the
window looked out on the ground. But there was no window anywhere,
and I feared it might be the same as in the dreams, for the thing
that I had seen was running down the passage between the rooms.
I ran to the window, but there was no window anywhere. I must not
sleep, for I am in a terrible state. This is not the end, for I shall
never be free from this horror. Will you let me shut my eyes?
I do not know what to do!

You are the first friend I have ever had, and I shall never forget you.
Thank you, and God bless you both.

====================
The "old" way seems to me the most accurate and reliable
to me. The old way does not give a straight line, but goes
through a circle. If the circle is as big as the "new" way, the
straight line must be a straight line through the circle, and the
straight line does not go through the circle. Each point is a point. The
phantom line is no line, but a phantom. It goes through the whole thing,
and so is a phantom. The old way is a phantom, and there is no
way of knowing it from the new. The old way is a phantom, and there is
no such thing as a new way. The old way is no way at all. It is a
trap for the ignorant. If there is no such thing as a new way, what
is it that we call a new way? If there is no such thing as a new way,
what is the distinction between a new and a phantom? If there is no
such thing as a new or a phantom, what is the difference between a new
and an old man? If there is no such thing as a new or a phantom, what
is the difference between an old man and a young woman? If there is no
such thing as a new or a phantom, what is the difference between an old
man and his mother? If there is no such thing as a new or a phantom,
what is the difference between a young woman and her husband? If there is
no such thing as a new or a phantom, what is the difference between a young
woman and her maid? If there is no such thing as a new or a phantom,
what is the difference between a maid and the master? If there is no
such thing as a new or a phantom, what is the difference between a young
woman and her maid? If there is no such thing as a new or a phantom,

by

My wife and I have been married for over a year, and we are both very, very happy.

Last week we took our first big day out. It was beautiful. The sun was so high that one could see the tops of mountains in the distance.
There was a very big green stone, so big that even the driver who was passing by could not see it.

It was named after me, and I was very proud of it, for I knew that it was a great
stone. But, alas! it wasn't big enough for any of us. So we decided that there was to
be a big party.

So we hired a carriage and told the driver to go round and round the inner circle of the
stone, and see if he could find a suitable seat for us.

When we were seated, I was very grateful to the driver for the service he had
given me. He was very patient with me, and looked after me very well. I
wasn't very happy with what was going on, but I knew that it was only my
own selfishness that was to blame.

I was going to tell him that I felt that the great stone was very, very
small--that it was only a century old or so--but I was afraid that
he might think I was trying to control him, and might think I was
making him angry; so I just said:--

"I know that you don't like the size, but I don't mind it, and I don't
mind it at all. I don't want to use to you. You don't use to me any more."

So I could see that he understood me very well, and I think he might
have felt that I was grateful to him for his kindliness, and was, I
think, just trying to be nice, for I felt that it was all very selfish,
and I suppose he was right in so feeling. But he only smiled at me, and said
very sweetly:--

"Well, Dan, you are a very good boy indeed, and I can only wish you a happy
life, and all that happiness may last; and I would like to make you a
present of it to me if I could."

"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!" I said, and
====================
There are 2 ways to do this:

1) You can use

You can import the list of distinct symbols in C
parsing, and then in

3) You can use

4) You can use this method

You can import the list of distinct symbols in C
parsing, and then in

5) You can use this method

Or you can use the other way.

Why?

Here is where you have an opportunity to help.

First, I need your help. I know that some will think that I am
peculiarly selfish, or that I am deliberately trying to harm you.

In any case, I have studied the method of the
_Misc_, and it has been a complete failure. I have tried
others, and I can say with complete confidence that there is
no such thing as a universally valid one.

I want you to have a go at this. I have written down, and shall
write down, all the symbols that you shall
use, and all the symbols that I shall
use.

I know that some of you shall be quite amazed at what I have
done. But you will understand, for there are other things
that are of greater importance to you than the happiness or
malignity of any one--what you call 'the good'--of any one.

I know that you are interested in the mysteries of the
physical world, and in the origin of all things; but you
also are interested in the facts of philosophy.

I have written down, and shall write down, the symbols of every
symbol in the book of C, together with its symbols as
expanded in exegesis to the highest degree of accuracy,
with the exception of the universal ones, because we must not
give to the mind of man a false idea of his own goodness.

There are, however, some symbols which we must not allow to enter
into the mind of man's goodness; for example, the mother of God;
and there are others, such as the sun, moon, and stars, which ought
to be given up altogether. There are other things which we must
not give up altogether as well, such as special ideas, such
as the idea of
====================
INGREDIENTS

1/4 cup honey

1/2 cup whole milk

1/4 cup sugar

1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

1/4 teaspoon nutmeasure

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/4 cup whole milk, chilled

2 eggs beaten

PREPARATION

1. In a medium saucepan heat the honey over low heat.

2. Once the honey has melted, add the milk, sugar, nutmeasure, nutmeg, nutmeg, and nutmeasure, and cook gently stirring occasionally for a minute.

3. Now add the heavy cream, remaining nutmeg, then cook gently, stirring often, stirring in egg after the mixture has thickened.

4. Bring to a gentle rolling boil and then reduce to a gentle boil, stirring constantly; then reduce to a low heat and cover.

5. Let stand for five minutes, then remove from heat.

6. To make the egg whites, beat the whites on a high speed for about half an hour; then add the yolks, beating well after each addition.

7. When the mixture has become stiff and yeasty, add the cold milk and beat well.

8. When all the yolks have been added, add the whites; beating well after each addition.

9. Once the whites have been beaten well, add the heavy cream and beat well, and when the mixture is thick enough to coat a work-bowl, add the remaining yolks, beating well after each addition.

10. When the whites have become thickened, add the cold milk and beat well, and when the mixture is stiff enough to coat a cold glass, stir in the grated nutmeg.

11. To make the glaze, beat the egg whites well on high speed for ten minutes, then add the sugar, egg yolks, and beat well, and when the mixture is stiff enough to coat a cold glass, beat in the grated nutmeg.

12. To serve, beat in the grated nutmeg and the fresh grated nutmeg, and serve.

You may store this recipe in a tight-fitting glass jars in the refrigerator.

====================
After a difficult life,
that was no place for a man. She had been a maid,
already, so had she gone through her life's tasks well,
and was now ready to be a wife, too. So why did I
not find out? I should have found out had I been available.

The Professor was in his office, but his mind was made up. He did not look at
all well, and he was sitting in a corner, muttering. I walked over to
him, and asked what was the matter, and he said:--

"What are you thinking of?" I was quite puzzled. I looked at him,
and saw that he was in the act of thinking.

"What do you think?" I asked.

"I don't know, I don't know! It's all so different! There's the
woman, and there's the man! I don't know either! The woman was a maid
before I was married, and she died young, and the man was a leper!
I don't know! I don't like the man! I don't like the man!"

"Then you don't know the woman?" I asked.

"That I do not!"

"Then you don't know the man!" I said to myself.

"No," he answered, "I don't know the man!"

"Then you don't know her!" I said.

"No!" he answered, and I knew he meant it.

Then I asked him if he knew the woman!

"Yes!" he answered, and I knew that he meant it.

Then I asked him if the man and the woman were married.

"No!" he answered. "I didn't know either. Why should I know the
other one?"

"Then why did you not know the woman?" I asked.

"Because I didn't know her!" he answered. "And I didn't know her
either. Why should I know either of them?"

"Then you don't know the man!" I asked.

"No!" he answered. "My mind is made up. I don't know either of
them."

Then I asked him if he knew the woman. He repeated his answer.

CHAPTER XXIV

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY

_18 June._--It was after dark when I called at the room where Lucy had been found. The door was locked, and I was not allowed in. I was kept waiting till the excitement had passed, when I was told that the inquest had started, and that Arthur was to be tried. I was to see Arthur later in the day, so I was very anxious, and waited, hoping that he might arrive at the place in time.

I did not hear from him for a few minutes, but when he did come I saw him quite absorbed in his work, and it seemed as though he were engaged in some great and terrible work. I asked him what it was, and he replied:--

"I have to report to the police. The inquest is over; I have to go on at once."

So he went away, and I went home, having a good night's rest. I did not sleep much, but my brain was working, and I had time to think over what had occurred. I was anxious as to what had become of Van Helsing, and in the night-time I visited the Count's room, and found him there--quite unconscious, I know, but alive, and speaking. He was talking with some one, and I could hear the words being said. I recognised the man as the one who had told the young lady to get up and come out of the room; he was talking to him in a very low, creeping tone, as though he did not know him. Under the influence of this inspiration, I went over to the bed where Lucy had been lying, and lifted her up, and put her face to it, and wept over her. I tried to restore her to life, but it was all in vain.

I had just finished up the work I had begun, when the door opened and the old woman came in. I followed, and she said to me:--

"I have something to report to you about, my dear; I have had to go away, and there is something
====================
But I ask him, what is it that you both seek!


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_17 November._--I awake, and found Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Van Helsing knocking at the door.
They were both very tired and very cold, but they all seemed to be in a sort of
enlightened humour. Van Helsing said that, in his opinion, the Count could not
live much longer; that he must be driven out of the castle or, perhaps, the
country, and that it was only a matter of hours before he was out of the
country himself. That the Count would have no difficulty in discovering or catching
him in his sleep, and then only might he be broken. Hawkins said that
he had read of a man who, when he was beaten with a stake, would rest in
a tree till the stake was no longer there. Van Helsing added that the Count
must at some time have been like this; that, wherever his will is, he
must, as it were, live in some branch of the tree. It will be a long time
before they are able to upset the wall around the castle. I hope that the
Count does not like it, and that it is but a temporary state. He will then be
free to do what he will. We shall have to make as much effort as we
can to interrupt his movements in any way.

I must, however, keep watch. I have to know what the Count is up to, or else
I am in danger. When I came in, the door was already flung open, and the
Count stood on the threshold. He was evidently _fond of_ Jonathan, for
he held out his hand, and took it gratefully, saying:--

"My friend, you are not tired; you are beginning to get sleepy."

"What does that mean?" I asked.

"That I have won a little ground. I am coming out."

"A little ground! You shall not gain much more!" I said, burthether he
might hear.

"And I shall be off!" said he, turning to Mr. Hawkins. "I shall be off
in the morning."

"And you shall not come back!" said I.

"Not at all!" said Mr.
====================
I didn't know you all then,
And you must have known me now, for you knew me then,
So I must have something to say; and to-day I must say something.

I want you to know that for to-day, for to-morrow, for to the end
Of the world, I am not at all sorry. When you tell me of your
dear father's death, you must tell me that you know that I
know. You must tell me that I know, for to-day, for to the end,
and for ever! You must tell me that you know that I know. My
dear father's death is all over me. I tremble, for I know with God
strength to endure. But if I did not know, my poor dear mother's
dear father's death must be all over me, and my poor dear Lucy's
dear father's death must be all over me. And so I must answer that I
did not know. And so I answer that I am sorry.

"Good-bye.

"Yours,

"R. H."

I have now enclosed some of the first letters which he has written to me, in which, in a somewhat hurried way, he says:--

"You know well by what terrible facts of my own life I have written; and I shall not now
write the same things in any more vivid form. I have had such a shock, so
awful a shock, and yet that shock does not leave me; it is only a shadow of
what it was. Yesterday I went to see my old master, Jonathan Harker. He is
nearly blind, and has only a few years of experience under his belt. The
night before yesterday he could not speak; he could hear only the talking
of the other blind men. This morning he spoke, and I could hear his voice all
over again. I said to him, when we sat down, that the time was now nearly
over, and that he was but a few days from recovery, and that if

Mina has been successfully treated. She is well, and seems to be in a much
better humour than she was yesterday. She will be of immense service to us
if we can get her to give us all her papers. It will of course be
a double service, for we must take them with us to the Exchequer. I
have therefore written to her solicitor, Mr. Jonathan Morris, to ask him
to get her out of Spain before nightfall. I have also written to the
Archbishop of Amsterdam, to ask him, in his official capacity, to
send word to the Spanish authorities that this object was of
the utmost importance, and that the best course would be to let
her out. I am, etc.,

"_9 September._--I received in the Austrian Consulate in Amsterdam

Mina. I hastened to meet with his personal friend, the Count's
excellency, the Count's consul, to whom I was directed to write at

====================
The purchase of a gun is a personal act. It is also a legal act. To purchase a gun does not mean to give away one's right to own a gun. The "give away" here is only in the same sense as the "give-away" of the "give me" operation in the same language.

The legal rights of a homicidal maniac are, after all, far from certain. But they do, I think, follow from certain facts.

He must have had

4. in the place from which

6. before the time the transaction took place.

Let me illustrate. I am taking up a pencil-case. I have mentioned before that when I was a boy I used to draw maps. I have not always done so, and I swear, if I may, to keep my property for a long time. I shall now draw the outline of the house marked in my maps. It is on this particular map.

I admit that I am, I think, a little slow in drawing. I think, for instance, that I have not been more careful in drawing out the edges of the frieze. This wall, as you know, is the line which marks the frieze of the house.

Am I to be blamed? No! I have been, I think, too much concerned with the details of the finish; and I believe there is some good in that. And there is good reason for it. I wish I could say that I was more careful than I should have been, but I cannot, as any one who has studied the subject will admit, and I am so used to the limitations of my own powers that I cannot, I am afraid, speak frankly. I am not a master of my own mind.

But I can tell you that, when I was a boy, and whilst I had never begun to write, I could not keep a straight line, and when I was about twenty-one I could not draw lines very well; but when I was a young man I could draw straight lines with the aid of a pencil, and now I can draw them with the aid of a pen, and I think
====================
I always thought that women were like cattle, and that if they were kept in cleanliness and order, they could well do some great and varied work; but when I had seen the women, as I have, in the churchyard at Whitby, I was struck at their ignorance of so many things.

They were, I thought, ignorant of all the diseases which men are; and of the importance of keeping these diseases under check. We know that, since time began to run out, the number of maladies of the body has been increasing, and that the cause is, as we have seen, the want of proper food. Men are, it may be, more than able to effect this end. And when the women are so ignorant that they cannot possibly be ignorant of things which they are, they are the more dangerous. Oh, my friend, what is the use of everything so simple as sex?

I thought that the most simple way of taking care of the women, and of keeping them unacquainted with certain things, was to keep them as far from the men as possible. This would have been of use to the poor women, and they would have been somewhat better off, I know, had I not noticed that all this would have had but a very slight effect.

It is, of course, true that such an experiment would have been in vain; for the women would not have been so ignorant as they have been, had he not given the order, as I understand, that he was to take them to the churchyard when he came. He must have broken down the door of the churchyard when he went in, if he was to have any chance of getting in. The poor women, brought out of their unhappy condition, must have felt as if they were being shot at.

I have already mentioned that I suppose the poor women, coming out of such a very unhappy condition, must have been too weak to submit to such treatment without some reaction. There is no cause for supposing, as some have, that their resistance was due to some disposition on their part to resist. It is not only true that Renfield's pet dog, the Wiltshire terrier, would not obey him even after a few hours' exercise, but that he himself says that he never had to use such force on a woman. In any case, I have seen no evidence of any strong reaction on any of them.
====================
"The writers of the 'Mystery of the Green Hell' just put their money on us," I said, as we passed into the room. Lord Godalming turned to me, and said gravely:--

"They are right. They put their money on it. When is the time? It is all in the game."

"It is all in the game," I rejoined; "but we can't quit it till we have found out what it is that is taking place."

"Then I shall get a search party, and ask them to go out at once."

"Is that all?" I said. Lord Godalming looked at me intently, and then at the Professor, and at last at the Count. He was of a different colour, with a dark chin and bushy eyebrows; he was of a younger frame, and his face was of a cool, stern simplicity.

"Yes, yes," he said.

"And so," I said, "how do we go about it?"

"How we go," he answered calmly, "is, that we go out in search of the Transylvanian money-lender; for if we can't find him we shall, I trust, find some one else who will."

"And what is that?" I asked.

"That, or some of his friends, might have stolen it."

"There is no way of knowing for certain," I said, "except by accident or mistake, for, without a doubt, some of us have had our hands in it. Besides, it is to be a very dangerous game, to be able to trace one's private papers to such an extent, even to a single individual. Do you think, then, that we can do without a search party?"

"I do not see how we can," he answered as cheerfully as he could. "I shall think about it. I shall be with you all the morning."

He left me with a firm resolution as to the details, and we went off to search for the Transylvanian money-lender. We were off at once, for we found him just as we had found him at Hulse.

CHAPTER IV

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_


When we arrived at the address given by the Count,
====================
Some people who know me well think I am a bit of a sneakerhead. Just as I have a nice pair of old Quonset hues, I like to look at the new ones. They are the exact same as those my father and I wore, and as I am a man of the world, I bought a pair from De Beers. They are more than worth the money, and I have some just waiting for me in my new office. I know that I shall never be able to wear these shoes as I used to, but I do not fear to look at them if need be; and I am a little ashamed to show them off to the strangers I meet.

I am not much of a doormat--I never am--and I have no intention of changing that. There are times when I do not like to be nice to a man, and I do not like to go out of my way to please him. I suppose it is a natural part of suffering to be on the outside, and I suppose it is part of the nature of man to want to please. I like to please, and I want to be loved; that is what the sneaker-head wants. I guess he is right in saying that I am a snob about shoes. I have a pretty strong preference for the old boots and the chaps, and I like to be treated as one. I have been in London a good deal and have not had much time to rub shoulders with the big-headed fellows, so I am starting for London to-day in my dress for the Exeter meeting. My own dress is a bit too long for me, but I shall try to get a little shorter in the future.

I must get a dress for the afternoon, so that I may not be so awkward in my new habit. I am going to lunch at the Castle Inn, and the doorkeeper promised me a room at the back. I shall not want it, for it is the dining-room; but I shall be near enough to the window to see what people are doing.

I found Professor Van Helsing waiting for me, and we talked over some of the things that had happened. He seemed a very nice and decent old fellow, and I did not like the idea that I should be too close to him. He did not like me either, so I was not expected to speak to him, but I must

====================
You can find the correct answer here:

How do we know that there is no such thing as the "super-luminous"
cause?

We do not know, for we do not know.

"How do we know that there is no such thing as light?"

In the Standard Model, the dark side is the limit of the curve
which the electron can travel. If the dark side were much larger,
it would not be possible for all the electrons to make it. If the
dark side were much smaller, the possible black bodies would be much
smaller than the curve would permit.

It is possible that a big, "super-luminous," dark side may exist.

Let us suppose that there is such a dark side; if so, what is its
purpose?

It would seem that the dark side is a matter of some importance. But
how is it that we find its existence; and how is it that we
know the existence of such a dark side?

We know from observation, just as we know from experience. Suppose that
I put you under the influence of a certain narcotic every day for
the rest of your life; and suppose further that for some time after
you have dosed you get, if not more, than you used to get under the
same narcotic. You will be in a state of very great exhaustion. You
will not be able to sleep, and you will not be able to think. You
will get very weak, and then you will die. You will die of asphyxiation.
How, then, do you account for the fact that for a great part of your
fifty or a hundred years you got the usual amount of sleep, and that
in your old age you are not so tired? You must be in some way affected
by this narcotic; and you must be affected by it in some way which we
do not yet know. You, my friend, are a student of the physical world, and
you are much interested in the physical world. You have studied the
physiological conditions of man; you know the causes of all known diseases;
you know the symptoms; you know the cure. You may be right in your
least of all; you may be wrong in your most.

Now, you say that you have studied
====================
We have had a very active week on the Quay. We have had a number of strange matters happen, and the men are beginning to get nervous.

I did not think I would be writing this, but after thinking about it a while I think I shall. It is not good to be idle, and I don't want to get on the nerves of the men.

It is not a pleasant thing to see--the odd looks and the
horrid smells, the silent hell, with rats and spiders and flies all about
them--but I have had to keep my eyes open for the laughter of the men, so
that they don't go blind. I don't want to take away their
jolly good-humouredness, but I suppose I should have been a better sergeant if
I had been a bit more keen-eyed. There is such a way between men and this sort
of thing in the days of the old sharpshooter, and I fear I may be the cause of
some of them getting so hysterical as to start for the doctor's room. I did not
think of the matter at the time, but now I see that I was wrong, for
I am terribly afraid that there may be more things going on in our
quarters than I can see and hear.

I am going to a friend of my father's who is a solicitor, and I am going
to have a chat with him about it. He is a very decent, good-humoured,
very kind, well-behaved man, and I think it will make me feel much
better. I shall get in touch with Arthur, and see what I can do.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_30 August._--I visited my father in his old house. It was a nice,
sheltered place, and there was much to see. There was a great big red
wagon, with a big red flag flying, which was a sort of triumphal
voyage over the white sand of the Quay to the Hainault estate. It had a
fat old man sitting in the driver's seat, who was very good-humoured, and
got up and down the road in a very pointed way, so that the horses
got used to him very quickly. The old man was telling us all sorts of
things about the property, and

A dash of blood was spurting from the wound on her neck, and she staggered to her feet.
The doctor, who had been lying still, raised his head and looked at her. She
gave him a look which said to him:--

"I thought you would not like me to see you, good doctor,
regarding it." He seemed surprised, and then turned pale as death, and
smiled all the more when he saw the blood was scattered on the floor.

"I did not mean to trouble you. I am all right,Miss Lucy,
hope you are--hope--hope." He sank on his knees beside her, and placed his
hands on her shoulders. "I have fought so hard for you. I have tried to
save you; but I could not save you; and now you are free and oh, so
good and so young and so strong and so dear to me, I give you my life
as you are, and all that is in you, for myself." She was silent, but
he did not seem to notice.

"And yet you die. God help me, I pray Him, to save you."

"It is no problem," said Van Helsing, "for me." She rose, and took his hand,
walking over to the bed and placing it there. Then she turned to him
and said:--

"You will forgive me, good doctor, for I know not what I ask of you.
I have been in pain, and I have suffered, and I have suffered, and I
have suffered; and yet I have endured all. I have endured the
torments which all men must endure if they are to live; the pains of
the dying; the pains of the dying, when they can die at all.
There are days when I do not know how long I shall live: and then at
such times I know that I have suffered. Do not pity me; I know not
what it is that I ask from you. I ask of you this, that you
will forgive me for my misfortunes. I know that I have done wrong, and
I know that I have done it to an injury that you will not forgive me.
But I do not ask for the world; I ask that you will forgive me,
that, if
====================
This is the best recipe ever

for a delicious roast chicken. The secret of
it is in the use of the garlic. The garlic, naturally
flowers in autumn, and the garlic is the most
enjoyable of all the flowers of the year. This garlic
is the best of all garlics in that it does not grow
anywhere but in the windows of houses; it is thus the
fountain of all that God loves.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 September, Varna._--This morning I
took my dinner to the table to be prepared, and found that
all was ready. The head of the roast had been cut off, and
the heart and other parts were roasted in oil as usual, but
this time the garlic and onion were added. I asked
Mina about it, and she said it was better than usual, as
when the garlic has been roasted it has a bitter taste, and
when it is not roasted it has no such bitterness; so she
said that if I would have some more I could add some garlic.

It is a hard lesson to learn when there is no such thing as
foul smelling garlic. I was not able to find any recipe
for garlic in any of the cookbooks, or in any of the
museums, or in any of the cookbooks of any sort, so I took my
cookbook and consulted with the recipe which I had in my
pocket. I found that to make garlic, the garlic must be cut
off, and then the heart of the animal cut off, and then the
torso of the animal cut off, as follows:--

1. Take the garlic, and cut off the root as much as the garlic
can carry.

2. Take the garlic cloves, and break them asunder.

3. Take the garlic, and break off the garlic stipe, and the garlic
stem, and the garlic bulb, and the garlic root; and all these
in small pieces.

4. Take the garlic, and break off the root, and all the garlic
stems, all the garlic stipe, all the garlic bulb; and all
of these, if they be

I was trying to get the "--wait, wait" entry so I could put my message in
the "--wait, wait" entry, when I noticed that the first box was already
completed--I was-I was, however, unable to keep it in mind. I have
acquired a habit of trying to remember when I begin a sentence, and
it seems that this habit has made a very marked difference in my
communication. I was in a strange sort of excitement when I found that
I had entered a phrase of "--wait. Wait. Wait." The words could not
have been more different from each other than I had expected, and only
after a prolonged effort did I come to realise that my brain was in
a strange state. I was quite sure that it had been in a trance, and that
I had simply forgotten that I had written anything. But I had not
foreseen that I should find myself in a situation where the difficulty
of memory might find its most marked expression. I had not, I believe,
thought of the difficulty of making a record of what I had seen, except
when I had tried to write it down in shorthand, but it should have been
easy enough to write it out, for I had the least difficulty in
remembering what I saw. I did not know how to begin my message, but
as soon as I had made my entry I could write it. I was not at all
surprised at all, for I had no idea as to what the difficulty was,
except that I must have been in a trance. I thought I would go over
with my shorthand notes what I had seen, and before long I should have
a little shorthand, and then I should be able to write it all down. I
came to the conclusion that I must have written it down, and once I
accepted it for what it was, it was impossible to change or to undo. I
looked up from my work, for I am at present busy, and I am
somewhat distracted by the whole matter. I shall take a look at the
symbol, and then I shall see if I can find out what it means.

_6 October. Peking. To my patient, Arthur Holmwood.

I write as to him with the knowledge
====================
The Taliban, whose leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, is in hiding in the desert, have been steadily draining the life out of the small mountain town of Bannu. They have destroyed the stone houses, and have cut off the main street, which runs through the old town. The roads leading from Bannu to the north are taken, for the road to Quetta, where the Bannu-Sakhar pass, runs through the town.

The collapse of the district of Bannu is a terrible blow to the enemy, who know that the town is of vital importance. But it is a general defeat for the enemy, for the movement of troops and of material is making so much difficulty that they can only grow weaker. The situation has now become one of absolute stalemate. It is evident that the battle of Bannu is all but lost.

The enemy are in a stalemate, and the only way they may be in it is to make a sudden movement. That is what the British, the French, and the American officials are doing. I have been told by officers who have been present that the British are attempting to get over the Bannu-Sakhar pass, as they think the best way to prevent the enemy being able to get over it in time. The impression I get from the officers and men in the advanced guard is that the only way to get over the pass is to do something, and that only a sudden change of plan, and the movement of a considerable body of troops, is really to be adopted.

All day yesterday the action was at its head. The troops, though thinned out by the draining of the Andes, ran madly about, and in the early hours of the morning were starting for Quetta. As they were coming up the pass, which runs through the town, the local men, who had been fighting back the advance of the troops, began to give way, and the whole line of troops was thrown back.

The British were unable to hold their ground, and were forced to retire, and by noon had altogether fled the country. The night was very dark, and it was impossible to tell where the troops might be to-morrow.

The situation of things is now that the British have at their disposal the route through Bukhara to the Tiv, and from there to the frontier. The enemy will, of course, try to force

God bless you for keeping this diary. I know that it will be of some use to you and to me. I have felt what it is to be alone, and that it is by the aid of this diary that we may learn. I shall write only of what I see. Forgive me if I am too much of a typewriter woman, but I have to type very fast and must type with great care, for I hope to get some disease or other in the next day or two.

I wonder if there is any light in the dark, if there is any need of me. I can see that all is dark and silent, but I cannot hear any sound.

It is very strange to me that all is like this. There are so many things going on in the world which I do not understand; and yet in a day I shall have all the knowledge there is of the things that are happening. You know how it is with me. I am in a fog, and I cannot see anything, not even the trees. I wonder if I have been thinking of anything all the time.

When you are alone you begin to get a feeling for yourself, and you begin to see that in you all the forces of nature are working, and that each and every one of you is working for your own happiness. And you begin to see that you are not alone. I am all alone, and yet I am helping others. I am helping you. I have no help in the world, and yet all I have to work for is my own happiness.

I am beginning to feel that I am getting old; but I shall not fear; I shall not give in to despair. I shall not give in to doubt. I shall not be content with the mere present, but look for the future!

I wonder how the children think. Is it because they see so little of their mother all the time? or is it because they do not like to see her?

How do they learn? Do they learn by books?

Do they learn by letters?

Do they learn by music?

Do they learn by pictures?

Do they learn by sounds?

Do they learn by smells?

Do they learn by tastes?

Do they learn by sounds?

Do they learn by touch?

Do they learn by smell?

Do they learn by taste

====================
When I was growing up I had a friend,
a thoughtful, good-looking fellow, named Hilderbrand. He was of the
noble blood, and was of a noble and sturdy stock. His father
was a nobleman, a very, very noble man, and his mother was a
poor, very poor woman. Her husband was a very, very honest man.
He and his wife were, in their way, very faithful, and had a very
sweet, sweet and loving nature. There were a lot of them, and they
had a lovely, noble, sweet, sweet nature as well.

One day, when my friend Hilderbrand was a boy, his father, a very
noble man, had a stroke in his life and was in a terrible way dying.
It was a terrible stroke, and there were people all around him, and
they were all doing their best to keep him away from the door. He
heard the people trying to keep him apart, and he heard the door
opening and closing. He knew that he had to go to the door, for he
could not go alone, and already the others were coming. He
went into the room, and there he saw his father lying on his bed
in a terrible way dead. There was nothing of him but a great, terrible
old-fashioned white dress, with a falling-open silk veil over it.
The old man's head was turned away from him as he lay there, but
he saw the white dress, and knew that he must go to the door. So
he got up, and he and the others went away, and he and they
kept looking.

Then he saw his father's travelling-garment about the room, and
he knew that he had to get the others, too. So he got the others
too, and he went with them, and they kept looking. And then
he heard a voice saying:--

"Come, let us go up to the window, where we may look out."

So they went up to the window, and they looked out, and they saw the
window of the house opening. There was a cloud gathering over the land
south of them, and it was beginning to darken. The sun was coming up
brightly, and it was almost overcast. And then the old man
====================
some of the most extraordinary ideas in the history of the human mind
have been put forward by men who would have been worthy of the title.

So let me ask you to consider this man, a man whose life is such
an example of what can be, and at what a time and place for the
purpose of his work. Of all the men that have ever lived, none have been
as active and vigorous and as free as he was in his day.

He was of a race which, in the beginning, was not much better than the
Slaves. He was on the eve of the Americanisation of his people, and
his own country was under the rule of a foreign power. His country was
anciently hostile to us, though, since then, we have been doing more
than all the rest to friend and to foe. He was in a sense the father
of us all; he wrote us our national song, and we are grateful to him
for the privilege of being his children and of sharing in his work. He
was a man of letters, and his diary is a treasure of facts and
events, but there are also times when he is of use as a guide for us. It
is a privilege to be in touch with him.


_Telegram, Jonathan Harker, London, to Jonathan Harker, Varna, 11 September
1929._

"_12 September._

"My dear John,--

"We write from the same city as yesterday. The telegram from your
regard to the phonograph yesterday was only to let you know that I had
received your telegram; but I had then a phonograph of my own. You will
all be able to help me if you have one. I have had a study effort getting
ready, to be sent to you at once. I want to find out how far you
can help me. I am trying to get my phonograph working, to see if I can
learn anything. You will make it work; I want you to help me. My mother
has been missing for some days, and I am anxious. I know that in all
the world there is no one in the land who can help me. I know that all
have had an interest in her coming and going; and I know that her going
might be of some use
====================
Mr. A. C. H. A.,

This is for Messrs. Harker and Harker
and for all who love them. I have written to you in case
you wish to know. If you have not heard, try to get a letter
out of me. I shall write one to the other at the time. Until then,
try to get as many copies out as you can. I shall send you
them in case you wish.


_Letter, Messrs. Harker and Harker to Messrs. H. H. and W. M._._

_11 September, afternoon._

"_John,

"My dear,

"I have received your note of September 11, and if it does not
fall out with what I have written, I cannot help it. I am sorry
that I have not been able to write as soon as I might.

"I must tell you that I am glad that we are not yet to the end. There
are many things which we must do before we can hope for the
promised happiness. It may be that we shall not get to it, but
that we shall begin to do it. We must not let the matter rest
without trying. The difference between Mr. and Mrs. Harker is,
that we are strong, and we have courage; but they are weak, and
we must not be obstinate. We must not be content with what we
have. We must try, and we must not be content. To try again is a
blessing, but to not try at all is a curse! We must try on all
the hopes which we hold, and we must not let them rest till we
try for each of them. This is our duty. I know that so far
as we ourselves are concerned we are not strong. We are men, and
our courage is our strength; but when we get to ask God's help,
our strength will fail us. We must not shrink from the task; we
must try to do it all the more strenuously, and with as much
effort as we have, and with as much courage as we have; for we
have not all the courage which we can give.

"We have not tried the whole. I do not know how it is that we
